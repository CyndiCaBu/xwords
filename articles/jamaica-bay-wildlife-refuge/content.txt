Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a place to forget about the city and enjoy some time in nature. Although it's part of the 5 boroughs of New York, it feels like another world. It serves as a safe place for wild birds and other creatures to rest, look for food and water, and even make nests. With salt water, tall grasses, and trees, it offers a sanctuary that humans can appreciate, too.

There's a visitor center at the entrance to the wildlife refuge. It has maps, samples of local wildlife collected by naturalists and restrooms. Park rangers working for the National Park Service provide information there and also guide visitors on walking tours at times.
After getting a permit at the visitor center, you can walk on the trails on your own. There are benches at various points to rest along the way. A shorter trail takes you to a view over Jamaica Bay, with houses and the Atlantic Ocean in the distance. It ends at a point where SuperStorm Sandy showed the power of water, cutting off a trail that used to make a loop around the refuge.

The longer trail goes past trees and tall grasses, around marshy areas and out into an open area.  Manhattan rises far in the distance, but it seems far away. Water separates you from the rest of the city, reminding you that New York really is made up of islands. A visit to the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge makes that quite clear. By bus, it takes about 45 minutes to get to there from Jackson Heights, Queens. If nature interests you, it's well worth the trip.
