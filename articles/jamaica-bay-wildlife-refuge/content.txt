{(Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge)[s] is[x] a place (to forget)[inf] about the city and enjoy some time in nature.}[t] {Although it('s)[x] part of the 5 boroughs of New York,}[f] {it[s] feels[vxs] like another world.}[t] {It[s] serves[vxs] as a safe place for wild birds and other creatures (to rest,)[inf] look for food and water, and even make nests.}[t] (With salt water, tall grasses, and trees,)[f] {it[s] offers a sanctuary that humans can[x] appreciate,}[t] (too.)[extra]

{There[s]('s)[x] a visitor center at the entrance to the wildlife refuge.}[t] {It[s] has[vxs] maps, samples of local wildlife collected by naturalists and restrooms.}[t] {(Park rangers working for the National Park Service)[s] provide[vxo] information there and also guide visitors on walking tours at times.}[t]
(After checking in at the visitor center,)[f] {you[s] can[x] walk[v] on the trails on your own.}[t] {There[s] are[x] benches at various points (to rest)[inf] along the way.}[t] {(A shorter trail)[s] takes[vxs] you[s] to a view over Jamaica Bay,}[t] (with houses and the Atlantic Ocean in the distance.)[extra] {It[s] ends[vxs] at a point where SuperStorm Sandy showed the power of water, cutting off a trail that used (to make)[inf) a loop around the refuge.}[t]

{(The longer trail)[s] goes[vxs] past trees and tall grasses,}[t] (around marshy areas and out into an open area.)[extra]  {Manhattan[s] rises[vxs] far in the distance,}[t] but[j] {it[s] seems[vxs] far away.}[t] {Water[s] separates[vxs] you from the rest of the city,}[t] (reminding you[s] that New York really is[x] made up of islands.)[e] {(A visit to the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge)[s] makes[vxs] that quite clear.}[t] (By bus,)[f] it[s] takes[vxs] about 45 minutes (to get)[inf] there from Jackson Heights, Queens.}[t] {If nature interests you[s],}[f] {it[s]('s)[x] well worth the trip.}[t]
