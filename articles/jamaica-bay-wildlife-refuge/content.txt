{(Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge)[s] is[x] a place (to forget)[inf] about the city and enjoy some time in nature}[t-n]. {Although it('s)[x] part of the 5 boroughs of New York}[f-ct], {it[s] feels[vxs] like another world}[t-n]. {It[s] serves[vxs] as a safe place for wild birds and other creatures (to rest)[inf], look for food and water, and even make nests}[t-n]. {With salt water, tall grasses, and trees}[extra], {it[s] offers[vxs] a sanctuary that humans can[x] appreciate}[t-n], too[extra].

{There[s]('s)[x] a visitor center at the entrance to the wildlife refuge}[t-n]. {It[s] has[vxs] maps, samples of local wildlife collected by naturalists and restrooms}[t-n]. {(Park rangers working for the National Park Service)[s] provide[vxo] information there and also guide[vxo] visitors on walking tours at times}[t=n].

{After checking in at the visitor center}[f-t], {you[s] can[x] walk[v] on the trails on your own}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] benches at various points (to rest)[inf] along the way}[t-n]. {(A shorter trail)[s] takes[vxs] you to a view over Jamaica Bay}[t-n], {with houses and the Atlantic Ocean in the distance}[extra].

{(One trail)[s] goes[vxs] past trees and tall grasses}[t-n], {around marshy zones and out into an open area}[extra].  {You[s] can[x] see[v] the Manhattan skyline}[t-n] {beyond the marshes}[e-p],  but[j] {it[s] seems[vxs] far away}[t-n]. {Water[s] separates[vxs] you from the rest of the city}[t-n] {reminding you[s] that New York really is[x] made up of islands}[extra]. {(A visit to the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge)[s] makes[vxs] that quite clear}[t-n]. {By bus from Jackson Heights, Queens}[f-p], {it[s] takes[vxs] about 45 minutes (to get)[inf] there}[t-n]. {If nature interests you[s]}[f-cd], {it[s]('s)[x] well worth the trip}[t-n].
