This character strength has a long name, but it&#8216;s not tricky to understand. It just means that you notice and appreciate beauty, excellence and/or skilled performance in all parts of life.
What do you find beautiful? The answers might depend on your experience, your education, your mood at the moment and other factors. Do you see any beauty in this photo of people waiting to buy food on a sidewalk in Beijing? One person might appreciate the tree, adding a touch of green life to an urban environment. Another might take pleasure in the bright colors of the little yellow-orange food cart and the clothes worn by the man inside it. The people who were actually there probably appreciated the skilled labor of whoever made their food. When people line up to buy dumplings from a certain vendor, it&#8216;s usually a sign that the food is good. Delicious dumplings could be an example of excellence.
Taking the time to notice even simple expressions of beauty, excellence and skill can help us feel good. It can lift us out of a bad mood by helping us notice what&#8216;s good or strong instead of what&#8216;s annoying or wrong. It&#8216;s linked to the main focus of positive psychology: What&#8216;s going well? What can we do to flourish?
