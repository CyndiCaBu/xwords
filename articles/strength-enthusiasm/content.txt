{Enthusiasm[s] is[x] a sense of excitement and interest in whatever you('re)[x] doing[vg]}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] when you feel a sense of passion and inspiration (to live)[inf] the way you('ve)[x] chosen to}[t-n]. 

{As a character strength}[f-r], {enthusiasm[s] is[x] also called[dtn] zest}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] increase it}[t-n] {by putting[ger] your passion and plans into action}[e-r], {doing[ger] something that you('ve)[x] wanted (to do)[inf] but (haven't)[x] done}[extra]. 

{(Juan Guillermo)[s], (a man who loves music)[extra], did[vxd] exactly that}[t-p]. {After years of working[ger] for a large company}[f-t], {he[s] started[vxd] his own business}[t-p], {Latin America Music Workshop}[extra]. {It[s] offers[vxs] musical training, instrument repair and more}[t-n]. {(The LAMW motto)[s] reflects[vxs] Juan Guillermo's enthusiasm}[t-n]: {"Alegria pa' todo el dia!"}[extra]. {In English}[f-cd], {you[s] could[x] translate[v] that as "Happiness for the whole day!" or maybe "Happiness all day long!"}[t-n] - {losing[ger] the rhyme, but keeping[ger] the meaning}[extra].

{Like any new business owner}[extra], {Juan Guillermo[s] spends[vxs] a lot of time working}[t-n-nq]. Still[l], {he[s] tries[vxs] (to spend)[inf] at least an hour outside}[t-n] {every day}[e]. {He[s] loves[vxs] nature}[t-n], so[j] {he[s] goes[vxs] hiking[ger]}[t-n] {when he gets[vxs] a chance}[e]. 

{(The image here)[s] came[vxd] from one of those hiking trips}[t-p]. {He[s] shared[vxd] it as part of a New Year's greeting to friends}[t-n-nq]. {(His message)[s] shows[vxs] his enthusiasm for life and the beauty of the world around him}[t-n].

{This[s] is[x] a trail between the Pacific and the Caribbean}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] called[dtn] the Camino de Cruces}[t-n], {or Trail of Crosses}[extra]. {Made of stones}[extra], {it[s] is[x] a historic trail from the 1500s}[t-n]. {It[s]  is[x] a trail where the Spaniards took the gold that they carried out of Peru}[t-n] {from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic}[extra]. {To be more specific}[l], {(the Indians)[s] were[x] the ones who carried the gold}[t-p]. {Once it[s] reached[vxd] Porto Belo}[f-t], {in the Atlantic}[extra], {it[s] was[x] shipped to Spain}[t-p].

{(This trail)[s] (hasn’t)[x] been[dtn] lost}[t-b] {in Panama}[e-p]. {It[s](’s)[x] been[dtn] erased by all the new buildings}[t-b], but[j] {(part of it)[s] still exists[vxs]}[t-n]. Finally[l], {after looking[ger] for it for a long time}[f-t], {I[s] decided (to walk)[inf] down the Camino de Cruces}[t-p] {today}[e-t], {for 20 marvelous kilometers}[extra]. Now[l] {I[s](’m)[x] completely exhausted but so happy (to have)[inf] walked on it}[t-n]. 

{(One of the wonderful things)[s] is[x] that when you walk, you have[x] time (to think)[inf] of everyone, each and every person}[t-n]. Best wishes to all of you!
