Like some other mammals, when puppies are first born they can’t see clearly. Their eyes don’t open for about 2 weeks, and they can’t really hear or smell either. Nevertheless, they can always find their mother to nurse. The mother dog is usually quite protective of her puppies and won’t willingly let anyone near them. They will all feel better if they have a quiet, protected area where they can be together, without much interference. They just need food and fresh water. Other than that, they will do better on their own. If a puppy crawls away or gets lost among its siblings, the mother dog’s favorite human could try to help, but in general people should not pick up newborn puppies. The mother dog would probably growl and she might even bite, especially if she sees someone who she doesn’t trust near her puppies. All that would cause unnecessary stress for the dogs as well as the humans. A few weeks after the birth, the puppies will be ready to start really exploring the world and the mother dog will get back to normal.
