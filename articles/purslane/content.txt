{What do[x] you[s] see[v] in this picture?}[t] {If you(’re)[x]  the person who gets paid (to cut)[inf] the grass in this Chicago park,}[f] {you[s] might[x] see[v] a weed.}[t] {On the other hand,}[l] {if you are[x] the kind of person who can[x] identify an edible plant no matter where it(’s)[x] growing,}[f] {you[s] would[x] be[v] correct (to say)[inf] that this is[x] purslane.}[t]

{Purslane[s] grows[vxs] easily and spreads[vxs] quickly.}[t=] {(Some people)[s] see[vxo] it as a weed,}[t] so[j] {they[s] pull[vxo] it out}[t] {as soon as they can[x].}[e] {Others[s] consider[vxo] it a wild food and appreciate[vxo] its flavor and nutrients.}[t=] {(My local farmers)[s] grew[vxd] purslane on purpose.}[t] {I[s] first noticed[vxd] it at the farmers market}[t] {a few years ago,}[e] but[j] {I[s] (didn’t)[x] recognize[v] it.}[t] {(One of the farmers)[s] told[vxd] me that it(’s)[x] known as purslane in English and verdolaga in Spanish,}[t] and[j] {she[s] gave[vxd] me a sample (to taste)[inf].}[t] {Since I liked it and I was[x] curious,}[f] {I[s] bought[vxd] some (to try)[inf] at home.}[t] {It[s] had[vxd] a beautiful bright green color and a fresh taste.}[t]
