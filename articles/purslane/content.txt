{What do[x] you[s] see[v] in this picture}[t-n-nq]? {If you have[x] any experience with a garden or a farm}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] see[v] a weed growing[ger] next to the grass}[t-n-nq]. {On the other hand}[l], {if you know how (to identify)[inf] an edible plant no matter where it(’s)[x] growing[vg]}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] recognize[v] that same plant as something delicious}[t-n-nq].

{Noah[s] was[x] at a farmers market the first time he saw[vxd] a plant like the one with red stems and rounded leaves}[t-p]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] recognize[v] it at all}[t-p], so[j] {he[s] asked[vxd] a farmer}[t-p]. {She[s] told[vxd] him that it(’s)[x] known[dtn] as purslane in English and verdolaga in Spanish}[t-p]. {Seeing that he was curious}[extra], {she[s] offered[vxd] him a sample (to taste)[inf]}[t-p]. {Noah[s] liked[vxd] it and bought[vxd] some (to try)[inf] at home}[t=p].

{He[s] found[vxd] that purslane lost its bright green color and became somewhat slimy in soup}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] had[vxd] a good, fresh taste in salads}[t-p]. {He[s] was[x] surprised (to read)[inf] that the taste and the nutrients can[x] vary[v] depending on the time of day purslane is[x] picked}[t-p]. {(Too much of it)[s] can[x] be[v] harmful due to cardiac glycosides and oxalic acids in the plant}[t-n]. Nevertheless, {(eating a reasonable amount of purslane in combination with certain other foods)[s] can[x] be a good source of vitamin A, folate and other nutrients}[t-n]. 

{Noah[s] (didn't)[x] feel ready (to harvest)[inf] purslane next to the sidewalk}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] was[x] glad (to keep)[inf] trying[ger] different things from the farmers market}[t-p].
