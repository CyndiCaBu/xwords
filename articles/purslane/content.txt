{What do[x] you[s] see[v] in this picture}[t-n-nq]? {If you have[x] any experience with a garden or a farm}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] see[v] a weed growing[ger] next to the grass}[t-n-nq]. {On the other hand}[l], {if you know how (to identify)[inf] an edible plant no matter where it(’s)[x] growing[vg]}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] recognize[v] that same plant as something delicious}[t-n-nq].

{Noah[s] was[x] at a farmers market the first time he saw[vxd] a plant like the one in the picture}[t-p]: {the one with red stems and rounded leaves, that is[x]}[extra]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] recognize[v] it at all}[t-p], so[j] {he[s] asked[vxd] a farmer}[t-p]. {She[s] told[vxd] him its name in two languages}[t-p]: {purslane in English and verdolaga in Spanish}[extra]. {Noticing that he was[x] curious}[extra], {she[s] offered[vxd] him a sample (to taste)[inf]}[t-p]. {Noah[s] liked[vxd] it and bought[vxd] some (to try)[inf] at home}[t=p].

First[l] {he[s] added[vxd] some purslane to a pot of soup that he made with other vegetables from the farmer's market}[t-p]. {He[s] found[vxd] that the purslane lost its bright green color and became somewhat slimy}[t-p]. {He[s] (didn't)[x] like[v] it very much that way}[t-p], so[j] {he[s] looked[vxd] for more information}[t-p]. {With another recipe}[l], {Noah[s] decided[vxd] that he preferred the fresh taste of raw purslane in salads}[t-p]. 

{He[s] was[x] surprised (to read)[inf] that the taste of purslane and the nutrients in it can[x] vary[v]}[t-p]. {It[s] depends on the time of day that purslane is[x] harvested}[t-n], {as well as other factors}[extra]. {Although it can[x] be[v] a good source of vitamin A, folate and other nutrients}[f-ct], {(too much purslane)[s] could[x] be[v] harmful}[t-n]. {(The plant)[s] has[vxs] cardiac glycosides and oxalic acids that can[x] lead to oxalate poisoning}[t-n]. However[l], {(reports of this in cows and other farm animals)[s] are[x] not common}[t-n].  

{Noah[s] (didn't)[x] feel[v] ready (to harvest)[inf] purslane next to the sidewalk}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] was[x] glad he bought some (to taste)[inf]}[t-p]. {He[s] planned[vxd] (to keep)[inf] exploring[ger] different things from the farmers market every week}[t-p], {(to open)[inf] his mind and diversify his diet[extra].
