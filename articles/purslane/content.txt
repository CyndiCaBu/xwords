 What do you see in this picture? If you’re  the person who gets paid to cut the grass in this Chicago park, you might see a weed. On the other hand, if you are the kind of person who can identify an edible plant no matter where it’s growing, you would be correct to say that this is purslane.
 Purslane grows easily and spreads quickly. Some people see it as a weed and pull it out as soon as they can. Others consider it a wild food and appreciate its flavor and nutrients. My local farmers grew purslane on purpose. I first noticed it at the farmers market a few years ago, but I didn’t recognize it. One of the farmers told me that it’s known as purslane in English and verdolaga in Spanish, and she gave me a sample to taste. Since I liked it and I was curious, I bought some to try at home. It had a beautiful bright green color and a fresh taste.
Purslane may in fact be delicious and healthy, since it has vitamin A, folate and other nutrients. Yet too much of it can be harmful to people and animals. It contains cardiac glycosides and oxalic acids, which can be toxic. Knowing that, if you’re one of these people who thinks that everything natural is good for us, please open your eyes to more than one source of information and more than one point of view. You can grow purslane and eat it if you want; just don’t eat too much at one time.
