 Santa Fe, New Mexico is a small city in the southwestern part of the United States. It’s located 7,000 feet above sea level, at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains. The sun shines most of the year, and the air is considered clean. There are state and national parks where you can go hiking and learn about the history of the area, including the desert and the forests.
In the desert, the sun heats the air during the day. It can be uncomfortable and even dangerous to be outside without protection from the bright light and incredible heat. However, the temperature drops as the sun goes down, and nights can be quite cold. The difference between the high and low temperatures in a single 24-hour period can be as much as 40 degree Fahrenheit.
To live in a place like that, it would make sense to build the type of house that takes advantage of the desert’s natural temperatures. People  have used traditional building materials like adobe for centuries to do this. In an adobe house, the thick walls absorb heat during the day and slowly give it back as the sun goes down. Inside, it feels cool, especially if the roof is  painted white to reflect the sun.
We should probably keep the lessons of an adobe house in mind as the climate changes. Why would  anyone want to use electricity and spend money for air conditioning when they don’t need to? Why don’t more buildings have roofs that are painted to reflect the sun? Why don’t  more buildings have solar panels to turn the sun into useful energy?  When will more building owners invite farmers to plant crops on their rooftops whenever possible, using rainwater and sunlight to create food? These are all questions to keep in mind as the climate changes. We should look at what has and hasn’t worked well in the past to help us find creative solutions for the present and future.
