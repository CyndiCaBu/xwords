{(Santa Fe, New Mexico)[s] is[x] a small city in the southwestern part of the United States}[t-n]. {It[s](’s)[x] located[dtn] 7,000 feet above sea level}[t-n], {at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains}[e-p]. {There[s] are[x] state and national parks where you[s] can[x] go[v] hiking[ger] and learn[v] about the history of the area}[t-n], {including the desert and the forests}[extra].

{(The sun)[s] makes[vxs] the desert intensely hot}[t-n] {during the day}[e-t]. {It[s] can[x] be[v] uncomfortable and even dangerous (to be)[inf] outside without protection from the bright light and incredible heat}[t-n]. However[l], {(the temperature)[s] drops[vxs]}[t-n] {as the sun goes down}[e-t], so[j] {nights[s] can[x] be[v] quite cold}[t-n]. {(The difference between the high and low temperatures in a single 24-hour period)[s] can[x] be[v] as much as 40 degrees Fahrenheit}[t-n].
 
{To live in a place like that}[f-r], {it[s] would[x] make[v] sense (to build)[inf] the type of house that takes advantage of the desert’s natural temperatures}[t-n]. {People[s] have[x] used[dtn] traditional building materials like adobe (to do)[inf] this}[t-b] {for centuries}[e-t].  {In an adobe house}[f-p], {(the thick walls)[s] absorb[vxo] heat during the day}[t-n]. {As the sun goes down}[f-t], {they[s] slowly give[vxo] it back}[t-n]. Inside the house[f-p], {it[s] feels[vxs] cool}[t-n], {especially if the roof is[x] painted[dtn] white (to reflect)[inf] the sun}[extra].

{We[s] should[x] keep[v] the lessons of an adobe house in mind}[t-n] {as climate change brings extreme heat and cold}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[vxs] critical thinking to see[inf] if the money we spend on electricity is[x] being[vg] spent efficiently}[t-n]. {Are[x] we[s] missing[vg] out on alternatives like energy from solar panels or food from rooftop gardens}[t-n-nq]? {That[s] costs[vxs] more in the beginning}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] can[x] offer[v] long-term savings and other advantages}[t-n].
  
{(Adobe houses)[s] are[x] examples of adaptation to the local environment}[t-n]. {They[s] remind[vxo] us (to consider)[inf] what has[x] and (hasn’t)[x] worked well in the past}[t-n] {as we search for ways (to slow)[inf] down and adapt to climate change}[e-t].
