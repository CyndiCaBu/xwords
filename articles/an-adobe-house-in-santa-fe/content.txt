{(Santa Fe, New Mexico)[s] is[x] a small city in the southwestern part of the United States}[t-n]. {It[s](’s)[x] located[dtn] 7,000 feet above sea level}[t-n], {at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains}[e-p]. {People[s] have[x] lived[dtn] there for centuries}[t-b], {from the Pueblo Indians who were[x] there first to the Spanish settlers who came later}[extra]. {They[s] adapted[vxd] to the desert conditions}[t-p].

{(Santa Fe)[s] is[x] known[dtn] for its comfortable climate}[t-n]. {(The humidity)[s] is[x] low}[t-n], and[j] {(average temperatures)[s] are[x] not extreme}[t-n]. Nevertheless[l], {(the sun's bright light and intense heat in the middle of the day)[s] can[x] make[v] it uncomfortable and even dangerous (to be)[inf] outside without protection}[t-n]. {(The temperature)[s] drops[vxs]}[t-n] {as the sun goes down}[e-t], so[j] {nights[s] can[x] be[v] quite cool}[t-n]. {In fact}[l], {(the difference between the high and low temperatures in a single 24-hour period)[s] can[x] be[v] as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit}[t-n].

{In a place like that}[f-p], {it[s] make[vxs] sense (to build)[inf] the type of house that offers shade while taking advantage of the sun’s power}[t-n]. {(Adobe houses)[s] do[vxo] this}[t-n]. {They[s] use[vxo] local materials like soil with a good mix of sand, clay and organic matter}[t-n]. {(Their thick walls)[s] absorb[vxo] heat}[t-n] {during the day}[shifter]. {As a result}[l], {it[s] feels[vxs] cool}[t-n] {inside the house}[e-p], {especially if the roof is[x] painted[dtn] white (to reflect)[inf] the sun}[extra]. {As the sun goes down}[f-t], {(the walls)[s] slowly give[vxo] back the heat}[t-n], {warming the house at night}[extra].

{(Adobe houses)[s] are[x] examples of adaptation to the local environment}[t-n]. {(Similar structures all over the world)[s] remind[vxo] us (to consider)[inf] what has[x] and (hasn’t)[x] worked[v] well in the past}[t-n] {as we search for ways (to slow)[inf] down and adapt to climate change}[e-t].
