{One morning in late summer}[f-t], {(my friend and I)[s] took[vxd] a ferry from Manhattan to Governors Island}[t-p]. {We[s] got[vxd] off and walked[vxd] up the hill (to admire)[inf] the views}[t=p]. {After taking[ger] some pictures of the skyline and the bridges across the East River}[f-t], {we[s] started[vxd] walking[ger] towards Brooklyn}[t-p]. 

{It[s] was[x] a beautiful day}[t-p], and[j] {(many people)[s] were[x] already on the island (to enjoy)[inf] it}[t-p]. {(The wind)[s] was[x] blowing[vg] in a way that felt like fall}[t-p], but[j] {people[s] were[x] still wearing[vg] summer clothes}[t-p], and[j] {it[s] got[vxd] hotter}[t-p] {as the day went on}[e-t]. {I[s] was[x] wearing[vg] a big hat (to protect)[inf] my skin and (to prevent)[inf] a headache from squinting[ger] in the bright sun}[t-p]. {For me}[f-r], {sunglasses[s] (aren’t)[x] enough}[t-n](;)[j] {(bright light)[s] bothers[vxs] my eyes}[t-n]. {That[s](’s)[x] why we walked in the shade}[t-p], {under the trees and next to some old buildings with historic exhibits}[e-p]. 

{Near the ferry that connects Governors Island to Brooklyn}[f-p], {we[s] found[vxd] something like an open-air museum}[t-p] {on a small pier}[e-p]. {We[s] read[vxd] about electricity and turned[vxd] a big wheel (to generate)[inf] it}[t=p]. {We[s] played[vxd] with a clear plastic tube full of trash}[t-p], {moving[ger] it around to see what was inside}[extra]. {According to a sign in the exhibit}[f-r], {people[s] used[vxd] (to use)[inf] the rivers as garbage dumps}[t-p]. {(To make that clear}[f-r], {(the tube)[s] held[vxd]  an old carrot, a horse’s hoof from the days when horses were[x] more common than cars, and other samples of unwanted things from the past}[t-p].

{(A young man standing[ger] on the pier)[s] explained[vxd] the connection between trash in New York harbor and creatures that live there}[t-p]. {By the early 20th century}[f-t], {(the harbor)[s] was[x] so contaminated that marine life died}[t-p]. {(Industrial waste from companies and trash and sewage from people)[s] took[vxd] away popular food sources like fish and oysters}[t-p]. {People[s] (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to go)[inf] near the water}[t-p](;)[j] {it[s] looked[vxd] and smelled[vxd] awful}[t=p]. {It[s] took[vxd] over 50 years for a change (to come)[inf]}[t-p]. 

{(An environmental movement)[s] helped[vxd] lead to the Clean Water Act of 1972}[t-p]. {That[s] changed[vxd] behavior}[t-p], and[j] {(the harbor)[s] is[x] much cleaner now than it was 100 years ago}[t-n]. {(More people)[s] spend[vxo] time on and in the water}[t-n] {as a result}[e-r]. {(My friend and I)[s] commented[vxd] on the irony of the ferry to Governors Island}[t-p]. {It[s] lets[vxs] us enjoy the better water quality}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] burns[vxs] a fuel that smells bad and harms the air quality}[t-n].

{We[s] were[x] just starting[vg] (to feel)[inf] hungry}[t-p] {when the young man began telling[ger] us about the Billion Oyster Project}[e-t]. {Because oysters help filter water as they eat}[f-r], {they[s] help[vxo] remove excess nitrogen and improve the water}[t-n]. {They[s] live[vxo] in beds that benefit other creatures}[t-n], {too}[extra]. {That[s](’s)[x] why the New York Harbor School, volunteers and restaurants are[x] working[vg] with the Billion Oyster Project (to bring)[inf] back oysters in the local waterways}[t-n].  

{(Listening[ger] to that)[s] reminded[vxd] me of an article I read after SuperStorm Sandy}[t-p]. {It[s] explained[vxd] that oyster beds change how the water moves close to the coast}[t-p]. {Like a speed bump slowing[ger] down cars}[f-r], {(oyster beds)[s] slow[vxo] down the energy from the waves}[t-n]. {Thus[l] (more oysters in the harbor)[s] could[x] help[v] prevent a storm surge like the one that flooded lower Manhattan in 2012}[t-n]. 

{(Talking[ger] about oysters)[s] made[vxd] me want (to eat)[inf] them}[t-p] {although I had a few doubts}[e-ct]. {I[s] wondered[vxd] if filtering[ger] dirty water contaminated the oysters}[t-p]. {(My friend)[s] said[v] he (didn’t)[x] want (to eat)[inf] oysters anyway}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] understood[vxd] pollution and the need (to reduce)[inf] it}[t-p]. {He[s] had[x] lived[dtn] in one place where a paper mill contaminated the air and another place where people used the beach as a toilet}[t-p]. {We[s] both wanted[vxd] (to be)[inf] part of the solution}[t-p], {not the problem}[extra]. 

Suddenly[l], {(a gust of wind)[s] blew[vxd] my hat off my head and straight into the East River}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] too far (to reach)[inf]}[t-p], and[j] {there[s] was[x] no way (to get)[inf] closer}[t-p]. {Since I love (to swim)[inf]}[f-r], {I[s] felt[vxd] tempted (to jump)[inf] in}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] knew[vxd] that could[x] get me in trouble in more ways than one}[t-p]. {We[s] tried[vxd] (to find)[inf] a pole or something (to reach)[inf] the hat with}[t-p], but[j] {we (couldn't)[x]}[t-p]. {I[s] realized[vxd] I had[x] (to let)[inf] go of my hat and my sense of guilt for being[ger] a trash-dumper like those people a century earlier}[t-p]. 

{I[s] told[vxd] myself the hat could[x] float off to one of the beaches in Brooklyn or even New Jersey and find a new owner}[t-p]. {It had[x] been[dtn] made in China}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] had[x] bought[dtn] it in Haiti}[t-p]. {I had[x] worn[dtn] it in Sao Paulo and other places in Brazil, as well as Chicago and New York in the United States}[t-p]. {In other words}[l], {it[s] already had[vxd] a history of traveling[ger]}[t-p], so[j] {maybe[l] {it[s] would[x] keep[v] going}[t-n]. (On the other hand)[l], {it[s] could[x] get[v] stuck on something near Governors Island and become[v] a habitat for small marine life}[t-n]. {Since it was[x] cotton}[f-r], {it[s] could[x] also decompose in the water}[t-n]. {I[s] hoped[vxd] it (wouldn’t)[x] be[v] around in 100 years}[t-p], {in another exhibit about humans who (didn’t)[x] respect nature and ruined the river}[extra].
