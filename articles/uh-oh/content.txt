{One morning in late summer}[f-t], {(my friend and I)[s] took[vxd] a ferry from Manhattan to Governors Island}[t-p]. {We[s] got[vxd] off and walked[vxd] up the hill (to admire)[inf] the views}[t=][t-p]. {After taking some pictures of the skyline and the bridges across the East River}[f-t], {we[s] started[vxd] walking towards Brooklyn}[t-p]. 

{It[s] was[x] a beautiful day}[t-p], and[j] {(many people)[s] were[x] already on the island (to enjoy)[inf] it}[t-p]. {(The wind)[s] was[x] blowing[v] in a way that felt like fall}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] was[x] still warm}[t-p] {outside}[e-p]. {I[s] was[x] wearing[v] a big hat (to protect)[inf] my skin and (to prevent)[inf] a headache from squinting in the bright sun}[t-p]. {For me}[f-r], {sunglasses[s] (aren’t)[x] enough}[t-n](;)[j] {(bright light)[s] bothers[vxs] my eyes}[t-n]. {That[s](’s)[x] why we walked in the shade}[t-p], {under the trees and next to some old buildings with historic exhibits}[e-p]. 

{Near the ferry that goes to Brooklyn}[f-p], {we[s] found[vxd] something like an open-air museum}[t-p] {on a small pier}[e-p]. {We[s] read[vxd] about electricity and turned[vxd] a big wheel (to generate)[inf] it}[t=][t-p]. {We[s] played[vxd] with a clear plastic tube full of trash and read[vxd] about how people used to use the rivers as garbage dumps}[t=][t-p]. {Inside the tube}[f-p], {there[s] was[x] an old carrot, a horse’s hoof from the days when horses were[x] more common than cars, and other samples of unwanted things from the past}[t-p].

{(A young man)[s] told[vxd] us about the Billion Oyster Project and its work (to bring)[inf] back oysters in the local waterways}[t-p]. {Oysters[s] help[vxo] improve water quality}[t-n] {by filtering it as they eat}[e-r]. {They[s] help[vxo] remove excess nitrogen}[t-n], and[j] {they[s] live[vxo] in beds that benefit other creatures}[t-n]. {(Listening to him)[s] reminded[vxd] me of an article I read after SuperStorm Sandy}[t-p]. {It[s] explained[vxd] how oyster beds change how the water moves close to the coast}[t-p], {slowing down the energy from the waves}[extra]. {That[s] could[x] help[vxo] prevent a storm surge like the wall of water that flooded lower Manhattan in 2012}[t-n]. 

Unfortunately[l], {(New York)[s] lost[vxd] most of its native oysters}[t-p] {about 100 years ago}[e-t] {because people (didn’t)[x] understand the ecosystem}[e-r]. {They[s] ate[vxd] too many oysters}[t-p], {forgetting the balance of give-and-take}[extra]. {They[s] contaminated[vxd] the water so much that marine creatures (couldn’t)[x] survive}[t-p], {not even tough ones like oysters}[extra]. {(Industrial waste from companies and trash and sewage from people)[s] took[vxd] away a food source and messed[vxd] up the harbor}[t=][t-p]. {Solutions[s] began[vxd] having a positive effect}[t-p] {after the Clean Water Act of 1972}[e-t], and[j] {(the water)[s] is[x] much cleaner now than it was[x] 100 years ago}[t-n]. 

{Standing on the pier}[f-p], {I[s] read[vxd] more about trash in the water}[t-p]. {(My friend and I)[s] started[vxd] talking about lunch}[t-p], {wondering which restaurants give used oyster shells to the Billion Oyster Project}[extra]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to eat)[inf] oysters}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] understood[vxd] pollution well}[t-p] {because he had[x] lived in a place where people used the beach as a toilet}[e-r]. {We[s] both wanted[vxd] (to be)[inf] part of the solution}[t-p], {not the problem}[extra]. 

Suddenly[l], {(a gust of wind)[s] blew[vxd] my hat off my head and straight into the East River}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] too far (to reach)[inf]}[t-p], and[j] {there[s] was[x] no way (to get)[inf] closer}[t-p]. {Since I love (to swim)[inf]}[f-r], {I[s] felt[vxd] tempted (to jump)[inf] in}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] knew[vxd] that could[x] get me in trouble in more ways than one}[t-p]. {We[s] tried[vxd] (to find)[inf] a pole or a kayaker who could[x] help}[t-p], {but[j] we[s] (didn’t)[x]}[t-p-nq]. {I[s] realized[vxd] I had[x] (to let)[inf] go of my hat and my sense of guilt for being a trash-dumper like those people a century earlier}[t-p]. 

Maybe[l] {(that hat)[s] floated[vxd] off to one of the beaches in Brooklyn or even New Jersey}[t-p]. Perhaps[l] {(someone else)[s] found[vxd] it, washed[vxd] it and started[vxd] wearing it}[t=][t-p]. {I[s] had[x] bought[v] it in Haiti and worn[v] it in Brazil, Chicago and elsewhere}[t-p], so[j] {it[s] already had[vxd] a history of traveling}[t-p]. (On the other hand)[l], maybe[l] {it[s] would[x] get[v] stuck on something near Governors Island and become[v] a habitat for small marine life}[t-n]. {Since it was[x] cotton}[f-r], {it[s] could[x] also decompose in the water}[t-n]. {I[s] hoped[vxd] it (wouldn’t)[x] be[v]  around in 100 years}[t-p], {in another exhibit about humans who (didn’t)[x] respect nature and ruined the river}[extra].
