{(Becoming[ger] fluent in a language you (0didnâ€™t0)[x] grow up with)[s] takes[vxs] bravery}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] not the physical type of bravery that makes firefighters rush into burning[ger] buildings (to save)[inf] people}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] is[x] the kind of bravery that lets you accept mistakes and frustration as part of the learning[ger] process}[t-n].

{Bravery[s] does[x] not mean[v] that you are[x] not scared}[t-n]. {It[s] means[v] that you accept the fear and try (to use)[inf] the language anyway}[t-n], {at whatever level you can[x]}[extra].

{You[s] may[x] feel[v] too intimidated (to interact)[inf] with others who know the language better than you do[x]}[t-n-nq], {especially if you('re)[x] shy}[t-n]. {You[s] may[x] start[v] a conversation with native speakers (to practice)[inf] but then get[v] stuck}[t-n]. {You[s] could[x] have[v] trouble following the other person's response or expressing your own ideas}[t-n]. {In that case}[f-p], {you[x] have[v] (to be)[inf] brave enough (to admit)[inf] that you (don't)[x] understand[v]}[t-n]. {You[x] have[v] (to be)[inf] humble enough (to ask)[inf] someone (to explain)[inf] or even translate[v] for you}[t-n].

{You[s] might[x] find yourself frustrated}[t-n], {saying or writing the right words in the wrong order}[t-n-nq].  

{If you[s] are[x] a perfectionist}[f], {you[s] might[x] avoid using the target language}[t-n-nq] {until you are[x] sure you can[x] use it well}[e-t]. However[l], {(the only way (0to learn0)[inf] a language)[s] is[x] (to use)[inf] it}[t-n] - {comfortably or not}[extra].

{You[s] need[v] (to read)[inf] about all kinds of topics in the target language}[t-n]. {Reading[s] builds[v] your vocabulary and your sense of how the language feels}[t-n]. {This[s] affects[v] your ability (to write)[inf] in the target language}[t-n], {another important language skill}[extra]. {You[s] can[x] start[v] with something basic like word lists and gradually learn (to express)[inf] your own ideas in a new way}[extra].

{(None of this)[s] is[x] easy}[t-n]. {You[s] must[x] be[v] willing (to feel)[inf] foolish or lost at times}[t-n] - {and keep trying anyway}[extra]. {You[s] have[v] (to give)[inf] yourself permission (to make)[inf] errors and learn[v] from them}[t-n]. {Bravery[s] gives[vxs] you the dignity you need (to persevere)[inf]}[t-n], and {perseverance[s] is[x] the key to fluency}[t-n].
