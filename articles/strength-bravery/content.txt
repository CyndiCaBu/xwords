{(Becoming[ger] fluent in a language you (0didn’t0)[x] grow up with)[s] takes[vxs] bravery}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] not the physical type of bravery that makes firefighters rush into burning[ger] buildings (to save)[inf] people}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] is[x] the kind of bravery that lets you accept mistakes and frustration as part of the learning[ger] process}[t-n].

{You[s] might[x] say[v] or write[v] the right words}[t-n-nq], {but in the wrong order, or in a way that others (don't)[x] understand[v]}[extra]. {You[s] could[x] have[v] a whole list of words memorized in your head}[t-n], but[j] {none[s] come[vxo] to mind}[t-n-nq] {when you need them}[e].

{If you[s] are[x] a perfectionist}[f], {you[s] might[x] not want[v] (to use)[inf] the target language}[t-n-nq] {until you are[x] sure you can[x] use it well}[e]. Or[l] {you[s] might[x] avoid[v] opportunities (to practice)[inf]}[t-n-nq] {if you[s](’re)[x] shy}[e]. {In both cases}[f], {bravery[s] means[vxs] feeling[ger] reluctant or scared and doing[ger] it anyway}[t-n].

{When we can[x] face something difficult, dangerous, painful or scary and deal with it}[f], {we[s] show[vxo] bravery}[t-n]. {(Reading[ger] about all kinds of topics in another language)[s] is[x] hard}[t-n]. {Interacting[ger] with others who know the language better than you do[x]}[s], {including native speakers}[extra], {can[x] be[v] intimidating[ger]}[t-n-nq]. {(Keeping[ger] a gratitude journal as a type of writing practice)[s] can[x] be[v] painful}[t-n] {if you dread writing in that language}[e]. Nevertheless[l], {fluency[s]  takes[vxs] effort}[t-n], and[j] {bravery helps[vxs]}[t-n]. {It[s] gives[vxs] you dignity (to persevere)[inf]}[t-n].
