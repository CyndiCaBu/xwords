{Think about a time when you told someone some good news, talked about a positive experience, or described something that made you feel successful}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] could[x] be[v] something simple}[t-n], {like watching[ger] a movie you really enjoyed, or finding[ger] out that you could[x] leave work early}[extra]. {It[s] could[x] also be[v] something more meaningful}[t-n], {like doing[ger] well on a quiz or spending[ger] a day doing[ger] what you love}[extra].

(An active, constructive response)[em]: {Did[x] you[s] really get[v] your own piano}[t-p-nq]? Congratulations! {Where did[x] you[s] find[v] it}[t-p-nq]?

(An active, destructive response)[em]: (Oh, no)[l], {did[x] you[s] move[v] it all by yourselves}[t-p-nq]? {It[s]('s)[x] freezing[vg] outside}[t-n]! {You[s] (could)[x] really hurt[v] your hands and your back}[t-n-nq]!

(A passive, constructive response)[em]: Hmm[l], {that[s]('s)[x] nice}[t-n].

(A passive, destructive response)[em]: Yeah[l], {I[s] had[vxd] a good day}[t-p], (too)[extra]. {I[s] went[vxd] ice-skating with my family}[t=p]. Afterwards[l] {we[s] went[vxd] out for some food}[t-p](;)[j] {it[s] was[x] great}[t-p]!

{You might[x] wonder[v] why the last response is[x] considered destructive}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] may[x] seem[v] positive}[t-n-nq] {since the person talks about a good day and pleasant activities}[e-r]. {However}[l], {(those comments)[s] take[vxo] the focus off the friend's good news completely}[t-n]. {They[s] ignore[vxo] what their friend experienced getting[ger] the piano}[t-n], {changing[ger] the topic}[extra]. {Even though that('s)[x] not overtly negative}[f-ct], {like the person who talked about the dangers of moving[ger] a piano}[extra], {it[s]('s)[x] still not supportive}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] encourage[v] the person (to keep)[inf] re-living[ger] the positive emotions of their own good news}[t-n-nq].

{We[s] (don't)[x] always notice[v] how we respond}[t-n-nq], but[j] {we[s] can[x] try[v]}[t-n].
