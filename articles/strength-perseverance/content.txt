{Perseverance[s] means[vxs] persistence}[t-n], {finishing[ger] what you start}[extra]. {When you face obstacles like difficulty or failure}[f-t], {it[s] can[x] be[v] hard (to persevere)[inf]}[t-n], but[j] {that[s] is[x] the point}[t-n]. {You[s] keep[vxo] trying[ger] until you reach your goal}[t-n].

{For Jaime}[f-r], {a college student majoring[ger] in environmental science}[extra], {perseverance[s] has[x] been[dtn] essential}[t-b]. {One semester near the end of his associate's degree}[f-t], {he[s] was[x] having[vg] a hard time in a biology course}[t-p]. Luckily[l], {experience[s] had[x] taught[dtn] him that he could[x] handle[v] it}[t-p] - {as long as he spent enough time studying[ger]}[extra]. 

{The previous semester, in another biology course}[f-t], {he[s] had[x] failed[dtn] one of the first quizzes}[t-p]. {There[s] were[x] so many new terms (to learn)[inf]}[t-p], and[j] {they[s] (didn't)[x] come easily to him}[t-p-nq]. {Although some people grow up hearing[ger] words like humerus, radius and ulna}[f-ct], {Jaime[s] (didn't)[x]}[t-p]. {English[s] (wasn't)[x] his first language}[t-p], so[j] {he[s] was[x] still learning[vg] lots of words}[t-p], {not just in his biology course}[extra].

{It[s] would[x] have[v] been[dtn] easy (to blame)[inf] the professor}[t-p], {who just stood in front of the class lecturing[ger] and showing[ger] too many slides (to count)[inf]}[extra]. {However}[l], {Jaime[s] knew[vxd] that it was[x] up to him (to learn)[inf] the material}[t-p], {no matter what}[extra]. {He[s] might[x] need[v] (to know)[inf] it for other courses later}[t-n-nq]. {He[s] had[vxd] (to persevere)[inf]}[t-p] {if he wanted to pass that biology course}[e-cd] {- and he had (to pass)[inf] if he wanted (to graduate)[inf]}[extra]. {(His ups and downs)[s] in his first biology course showed[vxd] him how (to do)[inf] it}[t-p].

{After that disastrous quiz}[f-t], {Jaime[s] found[vxd] out he (wasn't)[x] the only one having[ger] trouble}[t-p]. {(Some of his classmates)[s] were[x] worried about their own scores}[t-p], {afraid they might[x] not pass}[extra]. {They[s] started[vxd] studying[ger] together almost every day}[t-p]. {Jaime[s] decided[vxd] (to join)[inf] them}[t-p], {hoping[ger] that would[x] help}[extra]. {It[s] actually made[vxd] him study more}[t-p] {because he[s] reviewed[vxd] the material before each study sessions}[e]. {He[s] (didn't)[x] want[v] (to look)[inf] like he (didn't)[x] know anything}[t-p-nq]. 

{In the study group}[f-p], {everyone[s] asked[vxd] each other questions and explained[vxd] in ways that made sense to them}[t=p]. {By the second or third study session}[f-t], {Jaime[s] felt[vxd] comfortable explaining[ger] things to the others}[t-p], {which helped him reinforce what he was[x] trying[vg] (to learn)[inf]}[extra].

{(Jaime and his study partners)[s] all did[vxd] well on the next quiz}[t-p], but[j] {they (couldn't)[x] stop[v] there}[t-p-nq]. {They[s] had[vxd] (to keep)[inf] studying[ger] as often as possible}[t-p] {(to get)[inf] ready for the midterm exam}[e-r]. {They[s] spent[vxd] more than twice as much time going[ger] over things together as they did[x] in class}[t-p] - {teaching[ger] themselves}[extra]. Nevertheless[l], {it[s] was[x] worth it}[t-p]. {Thanks to their mutual efforts and support}[f], {they[s] passed[vxd] the class}[t-p] .

{Jaime[s] kept[vxd] that success in mind}[t-p] {in his next biology course and every hard course after that}[e-t]. {Even if a subject seemed impossible in the beginning}[f-cd], {he[s] knew[vxd] he could[x] do[x] it}[t-p]. {He[s] just had[vxd] (to make)[inf] a lot of effort and persevere}[t-p].
