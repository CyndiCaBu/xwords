# Step 1

Learn[v] which x-words can[x] hide[v] - only these three:

 - do[x]
 - does[x]
 - did[x]
 
# Step 2

Learn[v] their clues:

 - does[x] hides inside the verb and only the S shows 
 - did[x] hides inside every verb that('s)[x] in the simple past
 - do[x] hides inside verbs that are[x] in the base form
 
{In other words}[l], {if you see S on the end of the verb}[f-cd], {(the hidden x-word)[s] is[x] does[x]}[t-n]. {If the verb is[x] in the simple past}[f-cd], {(the hidden x-word)[s] is[x] did[x]}[t-n]. {If the verb is[x] in the base form}[f-cd], {(the hidden x-word)[s] is[x] do[x]}[t-n].

# Step 3

Use[v] one of these tools to find hidden do[x], does[x] and did[x].

 - {Change[v] a statement to a question}[t-n-nq].
 - {Change[v] an affirmative statement to a negative one}[t-n-nq].

# Examples

{Carrie[s] lives[vxs] in Cape May}[t-n]. 
 - {Does Carrie[s] live[vxs] in Cape May}[t-n-nq]?
 - {Carrie[s] (doesn't)[x] live[v] in Cape May}[t-n-nq].

{Last summer}[f-t] {Carrie[s] started[vxd] taking[ger] pictures of Cape May diamonds}[t-p].
 - {Did[x] Carrie[s] start[vxd] taking[ger] pictures of Cape May diamonds}[t-p-nq] {last summer}[e-t]?
 - {Carrie[s] (didn't)[x] start[v] taking[ger] pictures of Cape May diamonds}[t-p-nq] {last summer}[e-t].

{(Tourists)[s] visit[vxo] Cape May}[t-n] {(to appreciate)[inf] the beach, the birds and the monarch butterflies}[e-r].
 - {Do[s] (lots of tourists)[s] visit[vxo] Cape May}[t-n-nq] {(to appreciate)[inf] the beach, the birds and the monarch butterflies}[e-r]?
 - {(Lots of tourists)[s] (don't)[x] visit[vxo] Cape May}[t-n-nq] {(to appreciate)[inf] the beach, the birds and the monarch butterflies}[e-r].

# Step 4

{Review[v]}[t-n-nq]. {How many (x-words)[s] can[x] hide[v]}[t-n-nq]? Which ones? {How can[x] you[s] find[v] them}[t-n-nq]?
