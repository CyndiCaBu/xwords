{(The small dog walking with these people)[s] was[x] on a leash}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] on the trail}[t-p], {not in the woods or the water}[extra]. {It[s] seemed[vxd] well-behaved}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] (wasn't)[x] actually supposed[v] (to be)[inf] there}[t-p-nq]. {(A sign at the entrance to the trail)[s] made[vxd] that clear}[t-p]: {no pets on the trails}[extra]. 

{Since dogs (can't)[x] read[v]}[f-r], {we[s] can[x] only blame[v] the people}[t-n]. {Why did[x] they[s] break[v] the rules}[t-p-nq]? {(Didn't)[x] they[s] read[v] the sign}[t-p-nq]? {(Didn't)[x] they[s] care[v]}[t-p-nq]? 

{Rules[s], (like laws)[extra], are[x] meant[v] (to be)[inf] followed[v]}[t-n]. {(Some people)[s] will[x] follow[v] them out of respect and a sincere wish (to do)[inf] the right thing}[t-n]. {Others[s] will[x] only follow[v] rules that have[x] clear consequences and laws that are[x] enforced}[t-n].
