{In written English}[f-p], {(a sentence)[s] needs[vxs] at least two parts (to be)[inf] complete}[t-n]: {a subject and a verb}[extra]. {It[s] usually has[vxs] a third part}[t-n], {an object}[extra]. {That[s] makes[vxs] the pattern SVO}[t-n], {subject-verb-object}[extra]. 

# Trunk Means SVO

{SVO[s] is[x] the foundation for English sentences}[t-n], {like the roots and trunks for a tree}[extra]. {That[s]('s)[x] why x-word grammar calls SVO a trunk}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] the main part of the sentence}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] combine[v] trunks and other parts (to make)[inf] 7 different types of sentences}[t-n]. {Here are 3 of them}[t-n](;)[j] {(the others)[s] use[vxo] shifters, linkers and extra information called inserts}[t-n].

# Trunk

{Trees[s] have[vxo] roots}[t-n].

{They[s] grow[vxo] both up and down}[t-n].

# Trunk, plus Trunk

{We[s] can[x] connect[v] those to sentences}[t-n], {using a joiner}[t-n]. 

{Trees[s] have[vxo] roots}[t-n], so[j] {they[s] grow[vxo] both up and down}[t-n].

{In the sentence above}[f-p], {there[s] are[x] two different trunks}[t-n]. {Each[s] has[vxs] its own subject, verb and object}[t-n]. 

# Joiners are also called FANBOYS

{We[s] (can't)[x] use[v] a comma to connect two trunks}[t-n], but[j] {we[s] can[x] use[v] a joiner or something that looks like a comma}[t-n]: {a semi-colon}[extra]. {Joiners[s] are[x] also known as coordinating conjunctions or FANBOYS}[t-n]:

 - for
 - and
 - nor
 - but
 - or
 - yet
 - so

# Trunk with 2 parts

{We[s] can[x] also use[v] joiners (to connect)[inf] 1 subject with 2 or more verbs}[t-n]. {We[s] call[vxo] this a trunk with 2 parts}[t-n]. {Examples[s] include[vxo] these}[t-n]:

{Trees[s] get[vxo] energy from the sun and[j] give[vxo] us shade from it too}[t=].

{They[s] absorb[vxo] carbon dioxide and[j] release[vxo] oxygen}[t=].

{We[s] see[vxo] them and[j] need[vxo] them}[t=].

# {Why does[s] this[s] matter[v]}[t-n]? 

{(Learning to identify SVO when you read)[s] is[x] a valuable skill}[t-n]. {If you make mistakes in writing that a teacher calls run-ons or comma splices}[f-cd], {(looking for SVO)[s] can[x] show[v] you where you need periods}[t-n]. {If you read a complicated sentence}[f-t], {(looking for SVO)[s] can[x] help[v] you understand what it means}[t-n]. 

# Sentence Patterns and Rhythm

{SVO[s] is[x] the foundation of written English}[t-n], but[j] {(most paragraphs)[s] have[vxo] a variety of sentence patterns}[t-n]. Otherwise[l] {(the writing)[s] would[x] sound[v] monotonous}[t-n], {like in the paragraph below}[extra]. {(Each sentence)[s] follows[vxs] the same pattern}[t-n]: {Trunk, plus Trunk}[extra]. 

# A Paragraph Full of Trunks

{(The tree trunks in this image)[s] are[x] in lower Manhattan}[t-n], and[j] {(some tree branches)[s] are[x] visible in the glass behind them}[t-n]. {It[s] was[x] a partly cloudy day}[t-p], but[j] {(the building)[s] still reflected[vxd] the light}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] fall or winter}[t-p], so[j] {(the leaves)[s] were[x] already gone from most trees}[t-n]. {(People who know trees)[s] could[x] identify[v] at least one of these trees by the markings on its trunk}[t-n], yet[j] {they[s] might[x] not be[v] certain}[t-n]. {(The whole trunk)[s] (isn't)[x] visible}[t-n-nq], nor[j] {are[x] (the branches)[s]}[t-n-nq]. {(An image search)[s] could[x] help[v]}[t-n], for[j] {there[s]('s)[x] lots of information about trees online}[t-n].

# A Better Paragraph

{(The paragraph above)[s] needs[vxs] more variety}[t-n]. {Instead of using only 1 sentence pattern}[f-ct], {SVO, plus SVO}[extra], {it[s] should[x] have[v] some of the other sentence patterns}[t-n], too[extra]. {(Those patterns)[s] add[vxo] shifters, linkers and inserts (to make)[inf] SVO more interesting}[t-n]. {Are[x] you[s] wondering[v] what those words mean}[t-n]? {(Links at the bottom)[s] offer[vxo] more information}[t-n].
