 Good readers, like good language learners, know how to use the context to understand things. What does context mean? We can define it as the setting, which means the time and place where something happens. In terms of reading and writing, context includes the words or situations that you can read and understand around other words that you’re  trying to figure out.

We use context in everyday life to understand what’s going on around us. If you go to a bus stop and see a line of people waiting, you can safely assume that the bus probably hasn’t  come for a little while, and the people are  waiting for it. Now imagine that you see the same line of people waiting outside a movie theater. What do you think they are waiting for in this case? Of course you would most likely be correct if you guessed that the line outside the movie theater is for people who want to buy tickets, not get on a bus. The line is the same in both cases, but the context is   different.

Without enough information about the context, this photo of a kayak on the sidewalk may look a little strange. If you walked by and saw it there, you might think that someone was trying to get rid of it, since people often put bags of trash out on the sidewalk in a similar location. You can’t do very much with a kayak on the grass, and you certainly can’t drive it down the street. However, if you recognize this part of Astoria, Queens, very close to Socrates Sculpture Park, you know that the East River is  very close by. It would make a lot more sense to see the kayak in the water, a logical context, than here on the grass. Context makes a difference.
