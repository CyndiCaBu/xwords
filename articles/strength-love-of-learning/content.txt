{What does[x] (love of learning)[s] have[v] in common with curiosity}[t-n-nq]? {Both[s] are[x] character strengths that involve being[ger] open-minded and interested in the world}[t-n]. {(Love of learning)[s] is[x] about enjoying[ger] new information and looking[ger] for it from a variety of sources}[t-n]: {the internet, books, museums, experiences, people and formal education like school}[extra]. {Curiosity[s] is[x] about not getting[ger] bored easily}[t-n] {because you are[x] open to new ideas}[e-r], {even those that confuse you or disagree with what you already think}[extra]. 

{(My own love of learning)[s] combined[vxd] with curiosity and interest}[t-p] {when I chose the image above}[e-t]. {I[s] took[vxd] this picture}[t-p] {while changing trains on a long trip from Chicago to New York}[e-t]. {It[s] was[x] close to dawn}[t-p] and[j] {I[s] had[x] already spent[vxd] about 9 hours on the train}[t-p], {with 12 or more left (to go)[inf]}[extra]. {I[s] loved[vxd] taking[ger] the train}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] was[x] also thankful for the opportunity (to get)[inf] off and stretch my legs in Pittsburgh}[t-p]. {I[s] went[vxd] outside and took[vxd] a short walk near the station}[t-p], {admiring the city in the soft morning light}[extra]. {I[s] remember[vxo] seeing[ger] this beautiful ceiling and taking[ger] this photograph}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] (don't)[x] remember[v] the station looking[ger] like this}[t-p]. {I[s] started[vxd] doubting[ger] my memory}[vxd], {wondering[ger] if the picture was[x] really from Pittsburgh or maybe some other place}[extra]. {That[s] led[vxd] me to a fun process learning[ger] about more than I expected}[t-p]. 

First[l], {I[s] searched[vxd] online and confirmed[vxd] that the photo is[x] indeed from Union Station in Pittsburgh}[t-p]. {It[s] is[x] an example of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture}[t-n], {according to a Wikipedia article I read}[extra]. {I[s] was[x] planning[v] (to write)[inf] about interest as a positive emotion}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] felt[vxd] interested in what I was[x] reading[v] there}[t-p]. {(What surprised me)[s] was[x] the source quoted in that Wikipedia article}[t-p]: {the writer and architecture critic Brendan Gill}[extra]. {I[s] immediately contacted[vxd] his daughter}[t-p], {my friend and fellow x-word grammar teacher Kate Gill}[extra]. {I[s] told[vxd] her about my plan (to write)[inf] about Beaux-Arts architecture in the Pittsburgh train station and the concept of interest}[t-p].

{Kate[s] told[vxd] me that she was[x] happy her father would[x] be[v] part of this website}[t-p]. {She[s] mentioned[vxd] Here at the New Yorker}[t-p], {one of the many books he wrote}[extra]. {Mixing memoir with history}[f], {it[s] has[vxs] not only interest but curiosity, love, joy and humor}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] about his decades writing for the magazine}[t-n], and[j] {it[s] is[x] full of positive emotions as well as character strengths}[t-n].

{Since I wanted (to learn)[inf] more}[f-r], {I[s] went[vxd] back to the Wikipedia article}[t-p]. {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to re-read)[inf] what Kate's father wrote about that style in the Pittsburgh train station}[t-p]. {I[s] had[vxd] fun looking[ger] for more information about Beaux-Arts architecture}[t-p], too[extra]. {(Its French name)[s] comes[vxs] from an art school in Paris, France}[t-n]. {(Symmetry and grandeur)[s] are[x] some of the features of the Beaux-Arts style}[t-n]. {In New York}[f], {(the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the main branch of the New York public library)[s] are[x] both examples of that}[t-n]. {They[s] have[vxo] grand entrances with big columns at the top of wide stairs}[t-n], {with ornate details on the facades}[extra]. 

{After studying all this for pleasure}[f], {I[s] checked[vxd] the Wikipedia article about Beaux-Arts architecture one more time}[vxd]. {I[s] enjoyed[vxd] learning two more details}[t-p]: {(the French art school that taught this style)[s] was[x] in fact called l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] was[x] indeed pronouncing[v] Beaux-Arts wrong in my head}[t-p] {as I read about it}[e]. {No problem}[extra] - {for someone who loves learning}[f], {there[s] is[x] always more (to learn)[inf]}[t-n].
