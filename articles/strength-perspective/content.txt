{When Salvador started saving money (to buy)[inf] some land near the Paraná River in Argentina}[f-t], {he[s] was[x] not thinking[v] about snakes}[t]. {He[s] was[x] focused on finding a place where his family could[x] enjoy[v] the outdoors}[t], {playing bocce ball, gardening and swimming in the river}[extra]. {He[s] decided[vxd] (to buy)[inf] a small plot of land and build[v] a simple structure for them (to use)[inf] on day trips}[t]. 

{Over the years}[f-t], {(Salvador and his family)[s] have[x] made[v] friends with other people who like spending time near the river}[t]. {Some[s] have[v] houses there and stay[v] overnight}[t]. {They[s] all built[vxd] chain-link fences around their property (to keep)[inf] wild animals out}[t], {especially snakes like the one in the picture}[extra]. 

{Known in Argentina as yarará}[extra], {(this type of snake)[s] eats[vxs] water rats, frogs and other animals}[t]. {(Its scientific name)[s] is[x] bothrops jararaca}[t], and[j] {it[s] is[x] a pit viper}[t]. {Adults[s] can[x] grow[v] longer than 60 centimeters and measure[v] around 24 centimeters in diameter}[t]. {And yes}[l] - {(this viper)[s] is[x] venomous}[t], {like all vipers}[extra].

{(Salvador and most of his neighbors in the river community)[s] try (to keep)[inf] as far away from these snakes as they[s] can[x]}[t]. {They[s] know[v] that a bite from a bothrops jararaca means trouble}[t] - {even if it[s]’s[x] only a baby bothrops jararaca}[extra]. {(The venom)[s] is[x] powerful}[t], {leading to serious health problems, if not death}[extra]. However[l], {perspective[s] can[x] show[v] another side to this}[t-n]. {(This same venom)[s] has[x] also been[v] used (to develop)[inf] medicine for certain heart conditions}[t]. 

{Perspective[s] means[vxs] how we see things}[t]. {From the snake’s perspective}[f-r], {(the green kayak above)[s] was[x] a comfortable place (to rest)[inf}[t]. {Snakes[s] get[v] most of their heat from their environment}[t-n], and[j] {(the plastic kayak)[s] must[x] have[v] felt[v] quite warm in the sun}[t]. {(Laying there)[s] makes[v] sense}[t-n] {from the snake’s point of view}[e-r]. 

{From a human perspective}[f-r], {(sitting calmly in the kayak while taking this picture)[s] is[x] a different story}[t]. {Salvador[s] would[x] not have[v] done that}[t]. {Instead of taking out his phone}[f-r], {he[s] would[x] have[v] used the paddle (to try)[inf] (to get)[inf] the snake off the kayak and into the river}[t]. {Luckily for him and this snake}[l], {(another river neighbor)[s] took[vxd] the picture}[t]. 

{Like Salvador}[l], {(that neighbor)[s] was[x] born[v] on a farm nearby and grew[vxd] up in a small town a few blocks from the river}[t]. {He[s] understood[vxd] that bothrops jararaca[s] could[x] be[v] dangerous}[t], but[j] {he[s] also knew[vxd] that it[s] is[x] not the type of animal (to attack)[inf] first}[t]. {It[s] only bites[vxs] people if it feels threatened}[t]. {By eating rodents}[f-r], {it[s] actually helps[vxs] humans}[t]. 

{(Thinking about more than one side to an issue)[s] is[x] a way (to use)[inf] perspective as a critical thinking tool}[t]. {In positive psychology}[f-p], {it[s] involves[vxs] seeing the bigger picture}[t]. Here[]l], {that[s] would[x] mean[v] seeing the snake as one of many creatures in the ecosystem that Salvador, his family and his river neighbors all enjoy near the Paraná}[t]. {Perspective[s] can[x] help[v] them all live and let live safely}[t].
