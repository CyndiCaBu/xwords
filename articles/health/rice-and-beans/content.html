<p>You <span class="xw can_class">can</span> find people all around the world who enjoy eating fish and rice, or rice and beans, or all three. This picture <span class="xw was_class">was</span> taken by the filmmaker Naheem Adio, but he <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> tell me who dropped the food or how or why. It <span class="xw could_class">could</span> be from the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, so it <span class="xw might_class">might</span> be from a street vendor. On the other hand, it <span  class="could_class">could</span> also be from a restaurant.</p>
<p>Wherever it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> made, it looks delicious, even though it <span class="xw has_class">has</span> already fallen on the sidewalk. If you use your imagination, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> almost feel the lettuce and peppers crunching between your teeth. Depending where you<span class="xw re_class">’re </span> from, maybe you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> feel your fingers pulling pieces of the fish away from the skin and the bones. Perhaps you<span class="xw d_class">’d </span> prefer a fork, which <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be cleaner but a little more difficult than your fingers. The tomato looks like it <span class="xw might_class">might</span> be firm and not as juicy as a farm fresh tomato, but we <span class="xw can_class">can</span> pretend that it<span class="xw s_class">’s </span> full of flavor. The rice and beans look tasty, too.</p> 
<p>The whole dish looks something that someone <span class="xw was_class">was</span> really looking forward to eating. Too bad it ended up where it <span class="xw did_class">did</span>!</p>
