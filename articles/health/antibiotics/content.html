<p>Dimitri <span class="xw had_class">had</span> broken a toe while playing soccer. After an exam and some x-rays, his doctor recommended surgery to fix the broken bone. Dimitri <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> exactly like going to a hospital or surgical center, but he <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> want to <span class="xw have_class">have</span> trouble walking later in life either. He decided to follow the doctor’s advice.</p>
<p>About a week before the surgery, he <span class="xw had_class">had</span> some blood work done and <span class="xw was_class">was</span> given a prescription for an antibiotic. He <span class="xw had_class">had</span> read a lot about antibiotic resistance. He <span class="xw had_class">had</span> even known people who used antibiotics completely wrong, not finishing them and later sharing what <span class="xw was_class">was</span> left with friends or family, even with no evidence that antibiotics <span class="xw were_class">were</span> needed. He <span class="xw was_class">was</span> well-aware of superbugs, infections that <span class="xw were_class">were</span> hard to treat because the usual antibiotics <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> work anymore. He knew that antibiotics <span class="xw were_class">were</span> only useful for bacterial infections, not viruses. As far as he <span class="xw could_class">could</span> tell, he <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> have a bacterial infection, so why <span class="xw would_class">would</span> he need antibiotics?</p>
<p>When he told his mother that he <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasn't</span> sure if he really wanted to fill the antibiotic prescription the doctor <span class="xw had_class">had</span> given him, Dimitri got an earful in response. His mother <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a nurse, and her first reaction <span class="xw was_class">was</span> strong. “You really <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> want a bone infection, <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you? Look up osteomyelitis. If you <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> prevent it, the next thing you know, you<span class="xw ll_class">'ll</span> have a big, gaping wound and we<span class="xw ll_class">'ll</span> have to start catching flies to treat you with maggots!”</p>
<p>Dimitri laughed; he <span class="xw was_class">was</span> used to his mother’s sarcasm. An image of little white worms crawling on his toe came to mind. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> gross, but it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> also funny.</p>
<p>“You think I<span class="xw m_class">'m</span> kidding about the maggots, <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> you?” his mother said. “When I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> in nurses’ training in the 1960s, we <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a guy with a really bad case of osteomyelitis. They finally put maggots in the wound to eat up all the dead tissue. It <span class="xw may_class">may</span> sound disgusting, but it worked. The guy recovered.”</p>
<p>Dimitri listened, considering his options. Although he <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> ask, his mother offered more information. “Bone infections <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be really nasty,” she explained, “and they <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> always heal up in a month or two. You <span class="xw could_class">could</span> be on antibiotics for up to a year. You <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> want the bone breaking down, and you certainly <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> want your foot amputated! Think about it; the long term consequences <span class="xw are_class">are</span> not so pleasant.”</p>
<p>It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> clear that his mother <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a point. Dimitri <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> mind if she used sarcasm and humor to get her message across. She reassured him that the antibiotic his doctor <span class="xw had_class">had</span> ordered probably <span class="xw wouldnt_class">wouldn't</span> cause any trouble. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a short-term course of a drug with a long history. It <span class="xw wouldnt_class">wouldn't</span> lead to antibiotic resistance, and taking it <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be much safer than risking a bone infection. He knew she <span class="xw was_class">was</span> right.</p>
