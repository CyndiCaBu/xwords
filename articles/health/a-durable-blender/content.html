<p>This <span class="xw is_class">is</span> my friend's old blender; she bought it in the early 1960s. That means she <span class="xw has_class">has</span> <span class="xw had_class">had</span> it for around 50 years, although she <span class="xw hasnt_class">hasn't</span> used it much lately. In fact, she recently decided that it <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be better to give it to her daughter, who <span class="xw would_class">would</span> use it much more.</p>
<p>When she first got this blender, my friend made drinks and baby food in it. She used to make milkshakes and ice cream floats, especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda. She told me that people <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> <span class="xw have_class">have</span> smoothies in those days, but when it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> really hot outside she <span class="xw would_class">would</span> crush ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade. She also pureed fruit in the blender for her kids when they <span class="xw were_class">were</span> very young.</p>
<p>Although soup <span class="xw might_class">might</span> sound like a strange dish for hot weather, my friend said she used to make at least 2 kinds of soup in the blender, too. One <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a deeply colored version of borscht, which <span class="xw is_class">is</span> made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables. Another favorite <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a cold potato and leek soup that <span class="xw is_class">is</span> known by its French name, vichyssoise. My friend explained that when she made that, she <span class="xw would_class">would</span> cook the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock and then let it cool. When it <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasnâ€™t</span> too hot, she pureed it in the blender and then transferred it to a bowl to add cream until it reached the right consistency. She said that nowadays she <span class="xw would_class">would</span> probably use a hand-held immersion blender to puree soup right in the pot, but back in the 1960s she <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> know anyone with that kind of blender. She <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasn't</span> even sure if you <span class="xw could_class">could</span> buy one at that time.</p>
<p>Years later, after my friend <span class="xw had_class">had</span> lived in Ecuador for a couple years, she used the blender to mix frozen fruit drinks. One of her favorites <span class="xw is_class">is</span> mora, a type of blackberry. You <span class="xw can_class">can</span> see juice made from it in the image here.</p>
<p><span class="xw do_class">Do</span> you think a blender that <span class="xw was_class">was</span> made more recently <span class="xw could_class">could</span> last as long as this one? Time <span class="xw will_class">will</span> tell.</p>
