{Imagine[vxo] that you are[x] living[vg] in the year 2222}[t-n-nq], and {(the plant in the picture)[s] is[x] still growing[vg]}[t-n]. {(The yellow flower)[s] looks[vxs] like a type of prickly pear cactus}[t-n], {also known as nopal}[extra]. {Typically found in Mexico and hotter, drier parts of the United States}[extra], {(one just like this one)[s] surprised[vxd] me}[t-p] {on a sidewalk in Queens}[e-p].

Somehow[l] {it[s] grew[vxd] through four seasons of extreme temperatures and kept[vxd] growing[ger] year after year}[t=p]. {It[s] thrived[vxd] in the heat of summer and survived[vxd] the freezing cold and heavy snow of winter}[t=]. {It[s] wrapped[vxd] itself around a tree in front of an Italian restaurant}[t-p]. {just to the south of it}[extra]. {(The flower)[s] is[x] facing[vg] west}[t-n], {pointing[ger] towards the Empire State building in the distance}[extra].

{What does[x] (a symbol of Mexico)[s] mean[v]}[t-n] {when you find it outside an Italian restaurant in New York?}[e-p] {You[s] might[x] guess[v] that some people from Mexico worked in the restaurant or lived in the neighborhood}[t-n]. {You[s](’d)[x] be[v] right}[t-n] {although the owners of the restaurant were[x] Ecuadorean}[e-ct]. {You[s] could[x] also look[v] for clues about a link between Mexico and New York}[t-n]. {You[s](’d)[x] probably find[v] many}[t-n] {since people went back and forth between these places for generations}[e-r]. {It[s]('s)[x] possible that someone actually brought[vxd] a nopal plant from Mexico and planted[vxd] it here}[t-n], or[j] maybe[l] {someone[s] ordered[vxd] it from a nursery}[t-p].

{However it got here}[f-r], {(seeing[ger] the same plant in 2222)[s] is[s](n’t)[x] realistic}[t-n]. {It[s] (wouldn’t)[x] live[v] that long}[t-n], but[j] maybe[l] {it[s] could[x] reproduce[v]}[t-n]. {After all}[l], {(the prickly pear cactus)[s] has[x] been[dtn] around for thousands of years}[t-n].

{According to an ancient legend}[f-r], {(the Aztecs)[s] believed[vxd] that they should[x] build a temple and a city in a special place}[t-p]. {In the early 1300s}[f-t], {they[s] were[x] looking[vg] for an eagle eating[ger] a snake}[t-p], {sitting[ger] on top of a nopal cactus}[extra]. {(The cactus)[s] would[x] be[v] growing[ger] on a rock coming[ger] out of the water}[t-p]. {They[s] found[vxd] that on an island in Lake Texcoco}[t-p], and[j] {that[s](’s)[x] where they built the capital of their powerful empire}[t-p]. {They[s] called[vxd] it[s] Tenochtitlán}[t-p]. 

{(A long, sad history of conflict and conquest)[s] separated[vxd] the Aztecs from their empire}[t-p]. {(The Spaniards)[s] built[vxd] part of Mexico City}[t-p] {on top of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan}[e-p]. {They[s] even took[vxd] water out of Lake Texcoco}[t-p] {so they could[x] build in that area}[e-r]. {Why has[v] (Mexico City)[s]  faced[dtn] trouble with a lack of water}[t-b-nq] {for years and years}[e-t]?
 
{You[s] (can't)[x] see[v] water beneath you}[t-n] {when you walk around New York}[e-t], but[j] {it[s]('s)[x] below this city}[t-n], too[extra]. {In some places}[f-p], {there[s] is[x] water}[t-n] {only four feet below the surface}[t-n]. 

{(New York)[s] has[vxs] birds of prey}[t-n], {like falcons and hawks}[extra]. {(Bald eagles)[s] have[x] started[dtn] coming[ger] back}[t-b], {now that the water is[s] cleaner and ecosystems are[x] getting[vg] healthier}[e-t]. 

{Do[x] you[s] think[v] a powerful bird might[x] land on the nopal in this picture}[t-n] {like the eagle did[x] in Mexico centuries ago}[extra]? {Could[x] it[s] be[v] a symbol of a place (to build)[inf] a new empire}[t-n] {maybe a Mexican-Ecuadorian-Italian one}[extra]? {We[s](’d)[x] have[v] (to ask)[inf] the person who planted this nopal}[t-n].

Meanwhile[l], {we[s] can[x] each interpret[v] the nopal our own way}[t-n]. {To some}[f-r], {it[s] might[x] represent[v] empire}[t-n]. {To others}[f-r], {it[s] could[x] represent[v] a connection to home and perhaps hope}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] remind us (to adapt)[inf] and persevere}[t-n],{no matter what}[extra].
