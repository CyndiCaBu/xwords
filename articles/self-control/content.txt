The morning rush hour filled the streets of the Lower East Side with cars and trucks. Jasmin was walking to work from the subway station, covering her mouth and nose at the smell of exhaust. She felt grateful for the trees in Sara Roosevelt Park, a welcome break between the uptown traffic on one side and the downtown traffic on the other.

Appreciating the shade, she stood on the corner waiting for her turn to cross Chrystie Street. Cars were zooming past, trying to get through the stoplight before it changed. As soon as it did, she stepped off the curb to keep walking west. Suddenly, a biker crossed her path, almost hitting her. Jasmin stopped just in time, and they both shouted in surprise. Then the biker spit at her and kept riding.

Disgusted but relieved the saliva didn’t hit her face, Jasmin paused to clean it off her bag. Even though she understood all the pressures and dangers of riding a bike in the city, she was angry at the biker’s behavior. What made him think he was right? It was her turn to cross the street; for him the light was red. Was his problem ignorance or arrogance?

Jasmin kept walking to work, thinking about self-control. Something let the biker feel like he could do whatever he wanted; he didn’t even let the traffic law control him. She felt proud of herself for not cursing at him. She was trying to become more polite and studying techniques to increase self-control. Eating a good breakfast that morning had helped her. She thought about other tips she’d learned by studying self-regulation as a strength in positive psychology.

When our glucose level drops, it’s harder to control ourselves. Eating just a bit or drinking something with a little sugar can help.

Use it or lose it. By using self-control on purpose in other parts of our lives, our self-control gets stronger – like a muscle.

Valuing ourselves helps us regulate ourselves. In other words, self-love can increase self-control.

Self-control is an important part of academic success. According to some researchers, it’s more important than intelligence.

Jasmin smiled as she got near work. The biker was long gone, and she was in charge.
