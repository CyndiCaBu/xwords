{(Community supported agriculture)[s] ((CSA))[extra] is[x] a system that can[x] benefit both farmers and the people who buy their crops.}[t] {(The customer)[s] pays[vxs] for a season’s worth of produce in advance,}[t] (which helps the farmer financially by guaranteeing a certain amount of income.)[extra] {That[s] can[x] help{v] with planning and a sense of stability.}[t] {(The farmer)[s] doesn’t[x] have[x] (to worry)[inf] as much about whether or not a certain crop will[x] sell well at the market.}[t]

 {Farmers[s] can[x] use[v] websites, word of mouth and other ways (to try)[inf] (to get)[inf] CSA customers}[t] {during the off-season,}[e] {when they don’t)[x] have[x] (to spend)[inf] incredibly long days taking care of the farm.}[extra]. {(One successful CSA season)[s] can[x] lead[v] to another.}[t]


{(Many farms)[s] give[vxo] customers an idea of what they can[x] expect during the season,}[t] but[j] {you[s] never know[v] what you(’re)[x] going to get until you actually get it.}[t] {This element of surprise is[x] one of the fun parts of being involved in a CSA.}[t] {It[s] can[x] be[v] a chance (to try)[inf] vegetables that you[s] might[x] not choose on your own, or that you[s] may[x] not even recognize.}[t] {You[s] might[x] discover[v] something that you really like but had[x] never tried.}[t]


{(The way a CSA usually works)[s] is[x] that the customer goes to the farm or a pickup location once a week and takes home a box or bag of whatever the farmer has[x] harvested.}[t] {In some cases,}[f] {this[s] can[x] include[v] eggs or flowers,}[t] and[j] {there[s] may[x] be[v] some flexibility.}[t] (For instance)[l], {if you (don’t)[x] want cucumbers, {you[s] might[x] be[v] able (to trade)[inf] them for carrots.}[t] {(The best part)[s] is[x] that the food is[x] fresh,}[t] and[j] {(the business model)[s] has[x] helped[v] thousands of farmers over the years.}[t]
