Community supported agriculture (CSA) is a system that can benefit both farmers and the people who buy their crops. The customer pays for a season’s worth of produce in advance, which helps the farmer financially by guaranteeing a certain amount of income. It can help with planning, so that way the farmer doesn’t have worry about whether or not a certain crop will sell well at the market. Farmers can use websites, word of mouth and other ways to try to get CSA customers during the off-season, when they don’t have to spend incredibly long days taking care of the farm.


Many farms give customers an idea of what they can expect during the season, but you never know what you’re going to get until you actually get it. This element of surprise is one of the fun parts of being involved in a CSA. It can be a chance to try vegetables that you might not choose on your own, or that you may not even recognize. You might discover something that you really like but had never tried. 


The way a CSA usually works is that the customer goes to the farm or a pickup location once a week and takes home a box or bag of whatever the farmer has harvested. In some cases, this can include eggs or flowers and there may be some flexibility. For instance, if you don’t want cucumbers, you might be able to trade them for carrots. The best part is that the food is fresh and the business model has helped thousands of farmers over the years.
