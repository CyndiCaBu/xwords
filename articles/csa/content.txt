{CSA[s] stands[vxs] for Community Supported Agriculture}[t-n], {a system that can[x] benefit both farmers and the people who buy their crops}[extra]. {(The customer)[s] pays[vxs] the farmer for a season’s worth of produce in advance}[t-n], {before even seeing[ger] it}[extra]. {That[s] helps[vxs] the farmer financially by guaranteeing[ger] a certain amount of income}[t-n]. {(The farmer)[s] (doesn’t)[x] have[v] (to worry)[inf] as much about whether or not a certain crop will[x] sell well at the market}[t-n]. {(A CSA)[s] can[x] give[v] farmers a sense of stability}[t-n].  

{Farmers[s] use[vxo] websites, word of mouth and other ways (to attract)[inf] CSA customers}[t-n]. {During the off-season}[f-t], {when they (don’t)[x] have[x] (to spend)[inf] incredibly long days taking[ger] care of the farm}[extra], {they[s] may[x] have[v] energy for this}[t-n-nq]. {In the growing season}[f-t], {they[s] can[x] advertise[v] their CSA at farmers' markets (to encourage)[inf] people (to sign)[inf] up for the following season}[t-n]. {(One successful CSA season)[s] can[x] lead[v] to another}[t-n].

{(Many farmers)[s] give[vxo] customers an idea of what they can[x] expect at different points during the season}[t-n]. Still[l], {you[s] never know[v] what you(’re)[x] going[vg] (to get)[inf] in your CSA share until you actually get it}[t-n]. {(This element of surprise)[s] is[x] one of the fun parts of being[ger] involved in a CSA}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] be[v] a chance (to try)[inf] vegetables that you[s] might[x] not choose on your own}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] discover[v] something that you really like but had[x] never tried}[t-n-nq].

{If you join a CSA}[f-cd], {you[s] need[vxo] (to follow)[inf] a regular schedule}[t-n]. {You[s]('ll)[x] go[v] to the farm or a pickup location once a week and take[v] home a box or bag of whatever the farmer has[x] harvested}[t=n]. {In some cases}[f-p], {this[s] can[x] include[v] eggs or flowers}[t-n]. {There[s] may[x] even be[v] some flexibility}[t-n-nq]. {For instance}[l], {if you (don’t)[x] want cucumbers}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] be[v] able (to trade)[inf] them for carrots}[t-n]. {It[s] depends[vxs] on the CSA}[t-n].

{From the customer's perspective}[f-r], {(fresh food)[s] is[x] one of the main advantages of participating in community supported agriculture}[t-n]. {As a business model}[f-r], {(the CSA system)[s] has[x] helped[v] thousands of farmers}[t-b] {over the years}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[vxs] effort from both sides}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] can[x] definitely be[v] worth it}[t-n].
