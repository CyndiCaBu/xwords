Two things happened to me recently to remind me that nature is with us everywhere, even in an urban environment. As I was walking down the street with a friend, I felt my foot hit something lightly. I am so glad that I was wearing good sneakers, because when I looked down I saw a very small rat running away from us. It ran straight across our path and into a hole in the sidewalk. Although my friend and I walk down that street all the time, I had never noticed that hole in the sidewalk before. It was just a crack in the cement, next to a set of stairs, but it was big enough for the rat to fit through.  It made me think about the creatures that live under our feet, the ones we don’t  even know about.
The next morning I noticed a bird outside the kitchen window. It was  sitting on a branch the way the mourning doves do, but it looked much bigger. I wanted to take a picture, so I moved very slowly and carefully  in case it could  sense my presence.  However, it flew away before I could  get the camera ready. I decided to go outside to see if I could find it somewhere. Luckily, it was sitting in another tree nearby.  I got a few pictures of it sitting on the branch before it flew away again. I really hope that it found one of the local rats and had a good meal.
I don’t  know what type of hawk this is, but I’m  sure someone else does. If you are  a bird watcher or if you’ve studied birds and you can  identify this one, please send us a comment to let us know.  Thanks!
