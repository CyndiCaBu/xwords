{(A friend and I)[s] were[x] walking[v] down a busy street in the dark}[t-p]. {(Cars and buses)[s] passed[vxd] us}[t-p] {on one side}[e-p], and[j] {(an elevated train)[s] rumbled[vxd] by above them}[t-p]. {Although we saw a few trees on the sidewalk}[f-ct], {we[s] (didn't)[x] feel[v] close to nature}[t-p]. Then[l] {I[s] felt[vxd] something hit my sneaker lightly}[t-p], {like a little reminder that nature is all around us - a fast, furry reminder}[extra]. {I[s] looked[vxd] down and[j] saw[vxd] a very small rat running[ger] away from us}[t=p]. {It[s] ran[vxd] straight across our path and into a hole in the sidewalk}[t-p]. 

{(My friend and I)[s] walk[v] down that street all the time}[t-n], yet[j] {I[s] had[x] never noticed[v] that hole in the sidewalk before}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x]just a crack in the cement}[t-p], {but}[j] {it[s] was[x] big enough for the rat (to fit)[inf] through}[t-p].  {It[s] made[vxd] me think about the creatures that live under our feet}[t-p], {the ones we[s] (might)[x] not even know about}[extra].

{The next morning}[f-t], {(another creature)[s] surprised[vxd] me}[t-p], {this time from a distance}[extra]. {When I looked out the living room window}[f-t], {I[s] noticed[vxd] a hawk sitting[ger] on a tree branch}[t=p]. {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to take)[inf] its picture}[t-p], {so}[j] {I[s] moved[vxd] very slowly and carefully}[t-p]. However[l], {(it)[s] flew[vxd] away}[t-p] {before I[s] could[x]  get[v] the camera ready}[e-t]. {I[s] decided[vxd] (to go)[inf] outside}[t-p] {(to see)[inf] if I could[x] find it again}[e-r].

Luckily[l], {(the hawk)[s] was[x] sitting[v] in another tree nearby}[t-p]. {I[s] wondered[vxd] if it was[x] looking[v] for food}[t-p], {like the rat I('d)[x] seen[dtn] the night before}[extra]. {(Both the predator and its potential prey)[s] were[x] good reminders of nature in the city}[t-p] - {whether we see it or not}[extra].
