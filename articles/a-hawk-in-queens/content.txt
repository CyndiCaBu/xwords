{(Two things)[s] happened[vxd] to me recently (to remind)[inf] me that nature is[x] with us everywhere}[t-p], {even in an urban environment}[extra]. {As I was[x] walking[vg] down the street with a friend}[f-t], {I[s] felt[vxd] my sneaker hit something lightly}[t-p]. {When I looked down}[f-r], {I[s] saw[vxd] a very small rat running[ger] away from us}[t-p]. {It[s] ran[vxd] straight across our path and into a hole in the sidewalk}[t-p]. {Although (my friend and I)[s] walk[v] down that street all the time}[f-ct], {I[s] had[x] never noticed[v] that hole in the sidewalk before}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x]just a crack in the cement}[t-p], {but}[j] {it[s] was[x] big enough for the rat (to fit)[inf] through}[t-p].  {It[s] made[vxd] me think about the creatures that live under our feet}[t-p], {the ones we[s] (might)[x] not even know about}[extra].

{The next morning}[f-t], {(another animal)[s] reminded[vxd] me of creatures that spend more time over our heads than below us}[t-p]. {I[s] looked[vxd] out the window and saw[vxd] a hawk sitting[ger] on a tree branch}[t=p]. {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to take)[inf] its picture}[t-p], {so}[j] {I[s] moved[vxd] very slowly and carefully}[t-p]. However[l], {(the hawk)[s] flew[vxd] away}[t-p] {before I[s] could[x]  get[v] the camera ready}[e-t]. {I[s] decided[vxd] (to go)[inf] outside}[t-p] {(to see)[inf] if I could[x] find it somewhere}[e-r].

Luckily[l], {(the hawk)[s] was[x] sitting[vg] in another tree near where I first saw it}[t-p]. {I[s] took[vxd] a few pictures of it sitting[ger] on the branch}[t-p] {before it flew away again}[e-t]. {I[s] really hope[vxo] that it found one of the local rats and had a good meal}[t-n].
