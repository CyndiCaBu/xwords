{(Two things)[s] happened[vxd] to me recently (to remind)[inf] me that nature is[x] with us everywhere,}[t] {even in an urban environment.}[extra] {As I[s] was[x] walking[v] down the street with a friend,}[f-t] {I[s] felt[vxd] my foot hit something lightly.}[t] {I[s] am[x] so glad that I was[x] wearing[v] good sneakers}[t] {because when I looked down,}[e-r] {I[s] saw[vxd] a very small rat running away from us.}[t]{It[s] ran[vxd] straight across our path and into a hole in the sidewalk.}[t] {Although (my friend and I)[s] walk[v] down that street all the time,}[f-ct] {I[s] had[x] never noticed[dtn] that hole in the sidewalk before.}[t] {It[s] was[x]just a crack in the cement,}[t] {next to a set of stairs,}[extra] {but}[j] {it[s] was big enough for the rat (to fit)[inf] through.}[t]  {It[s] made[vxd] me think about the creatures that live under our feet,}[t] {the ones we[s] (don’t)[x] even know about.}[extra]

{The next morning,}[f-t] {I[s] noticed[vxd]a bird outside the kitchen window.}[t] {It[s] was[x]  sitting[v] on a branch the way the mourning doves do[x],}[t] {but}[j] {it[s] looked much bigger.}[t] {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to take)[inf] a picture,} {so}[j] {I[s] moved[vxd] very slowly and carefully}[t] {in case it[s] could]x]  sense[v] my presence.}[e-r] {However,}[l] {it[s] flew]vxd] away}[t] {before I[s] could[x]  get[v] the camera ready.}[e-t] {I[s] decided[vxd] (to go)[inf] outside}[t] {(to see)[inf] if I could[x] find it somewhere.}[e-r]

{Luckily,}[l] {it[s] was[x] sitting[x] in another tree nearby.}[t]  {I[s] took[vxd] a few pictures of it sitting on the branch}[t] {before it flew away again.}[e-t] {I[s] really hope[vxo] that it found one of the local rats and had a good meal.}[t]
