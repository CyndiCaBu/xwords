{When you put a pot or pan on the stove}[f-t], {which way does[x] (the handle)[s] face[v]}[t-n-nq]? {It[s] may[x] seem[v] like a strange question}[t-n-nq], but[j] {if young children are[x] ever in the kitchen}[f-cd], {(the answer)[s] should[x] be[v] easy}[t-n]. {(The handles)[s] should[x] always face[v] inward}[t-n], {away from any small hands that might[x] reach[v] up and accidentally spill[v] something hot}[extra].

{(Turning[ger] the handles away from the edge of the stove or counter)[s] is[x] a basic safety habit}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] something we do[x] all the time just (to avoid)[inf] trouble}[t-n], {like carrying[ger] scissors with the sharp tip pointing[ger] down, or staying[ger] away from the platform edge when waiting[ger] for a train}[extra]. {(These habits)[s] are[x] ways (to practice)[inf] prudence}[t-n], {a character strength related to temperance}[extra].

{Prudence[s] means[vxs] being[ger] careful and using[ger] good judgment}[t-n]. {It[s] is related to moderation and caution}[t-n], {resisting short-term temptation by focusing on long-term goals}[extra]. {When you make wise decisions based on what is[x] right}[t-n], {or what is[x] good for you}[extra], {you[s](‘re)[x] practicing[v] prudence}[t-n]. 

{(Rules and laws)[s] encourage[vxo] people (to use)[inf] this strength}[t-n]. {For example}[l], {you[s] (can’t)[x] participate[v] in free kayaking[ger]}[t-n-nq] {at The Downtown Boathouse}[e-p] {unless you sign a waiver, wear a life jacket and already know how (to swim)[inf]}[e-cd]. {(The waiver)[s] is[x] a form of prudence protecting The Downtown Boathouse}[t-n]. {Are[x] you[s] the kind of person who practices prudence and kayaks smoothly}[t-n-nq], or[j] {are[x] you[s] more interested in rocking the boat}[t-n-nq]?
