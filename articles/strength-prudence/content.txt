When you put a pot or pan on the stove, which way does the handle face? It may seem like a strange question, but if young children are ever in the kitchen, the answer should be easy. The handles always face inward, away from any small hands that might reach up and accidentally spill something hot on the child below. Turning the handles away from the edge of the stove or counter is a basic safety habit. It&#8216;s something we do all the time just to avoid trouble, like carrying scissors with the sharp tip pointing down, or staying away from the platform edge when waiting for a train. These are all different ways to practice prudence, a character strength related to temperance.
Prudence means being careful and using good judgment. It means you make wise decisions based on what&#8216;s good for you, or what&#8216;s right. For a construction worker, prudence can mean the difference between health and injury, or even life and death. It &#8216;s an essential character strength. Wearing a hard hat might not always be the most comfortable choice, but head injuries
are no fun either. Using a harness to attach to a lifeline, like the man in the photo was doing, can seem like a pain. However, there&#8216;s a reason it&#8216;s called a lifeline.
The man pictured here is probably about 6 feet tall. As he smiled for the camera, he explained some of the requirements of OSHA, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Whenever someone is working at any height of 6 feet or more, they must use something to stop them if they fall. The worker shown here pointed to the harness he was wearing and explained how a shock-absorbing lanyard or a retractable lifeline could protect him. He clearly knew how to be careful at work. His hardhat, harness, lifeline and even sunglasses can all be seen as clues to his prudence.
