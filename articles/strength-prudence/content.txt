{When you put a pot or pan on the stove}[f-t], {which way does[x] (the handle)[s] face[v]}[t-n-nq]? {It[s] may[x] seem[v] like a strange question}[t-n-nq], but[j] {if young children are[x] ever in the kitchen}[f-cd], {the answer should[x] be[v] easy}[t-n]. {(The handles)[s] should[x] always face[v] inward}[t-n], {away from any small hands that might[x] reach up and accidentally spill something hot}[extra]. 

{(Turning the handles away from the edge of the stove or counter)[s] is[x] a basic safety habit}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] something we do[x] all the time just (to avoid)[inf] trouble}[t-n], {like carrying scissors with the sharp tip pointing down, or staying away from the platform edge when waiting for a train}[extra]. {These[s] are[x] all different ways (to practice)[inf] prudence}[t-n], {a character strength related to temperance}[extra].
