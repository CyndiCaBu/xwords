# Before with hidden did[x]

{(The simple past in the -ed and irregular form)[s] makes[vxs] the past easy (to recognize)[inf]}[t-n], {like in “laughed” here}[extra]:

{Max[s] laughed[vxd] out loud}[t-p] {when he saw[vxd] this toy horse outside one morning}[e-t].

# Now with hidden does[x]

{(The simple present)[s] has[x] -s or -es on the end of the verb}[t-n], {as in “walks, says and refuses” below}[extra].

{He[s] walks[vxs] down that street often and says[vxs] he never saw anything like that there before}[t=p]. {He[s] refuses[vxs] (to throw)[inf] away cute toys like that from his own family}[t-n], {explaining[ger] that it(’s)[x] more useful (to donate)[inf] them to a thrift shop}[extra].

{In the two sentences above}[f-p], {(“has[x] given[dtn]” and “have[x] started[dtn]”)[s] show[vxo] a connection between the past and now}[t-n]. {(Max and his family)[s] did[vxd] something}[t-p] {at least once before}[e-t], but[j] {we[s] (don’t)[x] know[v] exactly when or how many times}[t-n]. {They[s](’ll)[x] probably do[x] it again}[t-n] {in the future}[e-t]. {(The x-words "has" and "have" with the DTN form of the verb)[s] show[vxo] that connection between before and now}[t-n].
