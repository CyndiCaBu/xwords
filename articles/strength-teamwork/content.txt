{Teamwork[s] means[vxs] working together (to reach)[inf] a goal}[t-n]. {By focusing on a shared purpose instead of our own ego}[f-r], {we[s] can[x] help[v] our team be effective}[t-n]. {(A team)[s] can[x]] be[v] a group of athletes, students or other people working together (to get)[inf] something done}[t-n].

{In Malawi}[f-p], {(a young problem-solver named William Kamkwamba)[s] used[vxd] teamwork (to solve)[inf] a basic problem}[t-p]: {a lack of light (to study)[inf] by at night}[extra]. {(His story)[s] shows[vxs] how a curious kid with limited resources worked with others (to help)[inf] not only his family but his village}[t-n]. {(A domino effect)[s] took[vxd] him far from rural Malawi (to study)[inf] on two different continents}[t-p]. {Afterwards}[l], {he[s] went[vxd] back to his native country}[t-p] {(to keep)[inf] helping others}[e-r]. {Kamkwamba[s] is[x] an inventor with an entrepreneurial outlook}[t-n]. {In addition to teamwork}[l], {(his strengths)[s] include[vxo] love of learning, persistence and leadership}[t-n]. 

{Kamkwamba[s] teamed[v] with many others (to share)[inf] his story on the radio, on stage and online}[t-p]. {(Bryan Mealer)[s], (a writer)[extra], helped[vxd] him with the book (The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind)[title]. {(Ben Nabors)[s], (who took the photo here)[extra], directed[vxd] and produced[vxd] a documentary film called William and the Windmill[title]}[t=p]. 

{In an English course in New York}[f-p], {(a student named DM)[s] read[vxd] Kamkwamba's book and wrote[vxd] the essay below in response}[t=p].
 
{(Becoming a hero)[s] (doesn’t)[x] mean[v] only being a person who does[x] something special in a war}[t-p]. {(What is important for a hero)[s] is[x] sacrificing[v] part of one’s own life (to help)[inf] provide a better and easier life for other people}[t-n-nq]. {(William Kamkwamba)[s], (a citizen of Malawi)[extra], is[x] a great example of someone who believed in himself and struggled (to defeat)[inf] adversity}[t-n-nq].

{As a 14-year-old boy}[extra], {Kamkwamba[s] had[vxd] (to leave)[inf] school}[t-p] {because his parents couldn’t afford it}[e-r]. {Frustrated but determined (to keep)[inf] learning}[f], {he[s] decided[vxd] (to teach)[inf] himself by going to his village’s library}[t-p]. {Although it was small}[f-ct], {it[s] had[vxd] textbooks from Malawi, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe}[t-p]. {He[s] found[vxd] the same books that students were[x] reading in his former school}[t-p], so[j] {he[s] borrowed[vxd] them and asked[vxd] his friends (to give)[inf] him updates on what they had done in class each day}[t=p]. {(A few science books)[s] caught[vxd] his attention}[t-p], {especially the ones with pictures showing how things work}[extra]. {(His native language) is Chichewa}[t-n], and[j] {(reading in English)[s] was[x] hard}[t-p] {at first}[e-t]. {He[s] persevered[vxd]}[t-p] {because he really liked[vxd] science}[e-r]. {He[s] soon began[vxd] learning more and more about energy and how windmills could[x] produce it}[t-p]. {By studying something that he had[x] never learned before}[f], {Kamkwamba[s] developed[vxd] confidence in himself and realized[vxd] that he could[x] actually build a windmill}[t=p-nq]. {He[s] started[vxd] going to the junkyard next to his high school}[t-p] {(to look)[inf] for all the parts he needed}[e-r]. {(His friends)[s] helped[vxd] him find an old wheel from a bicycle, a couple pieces of wood, metal plates and more}[t-p]. {He[s] kept[vxd] going}[t-p] {even when people made fun of him}[extra]. {He[s] managed[vxd] (to build)[inf] an experimental windmill}[t-p]. {It[s] looked[vxd] like it could[x] fall over in strong wind}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] let[vxd] him power an electric light bulb that he put way up at the top}[t-p]. {(People in the village)[s] noticed[vxd] the light from a distance and started[vxd] changing their opinion about him}[t=p]. {He[s] (wasn’t)[x] a kid with a mental illness who spent his days in the junkyard for no reason}[t-p] {like some people said}[extra]. {On the contrary}[l], {he[s] seemed[vxd] quite intelligent and skillful}[t-p]. {Thanks to his windmill}[l], {(Kamkwamba’s family)[s] was[x] able (to use)[inf] simple electrical things like a light bulb}[t-p], so {they[s] could[x] read[v] and study[v] at night}[t-p].

{After a Malawian newspaper wrote about Kamkwamba and his windmill and some bloggers from America and Nigeria shared his story}[f-t], {(more and more people)[s] learned[vxd] about his work}[t-p]. {Soon}[l] {people[s] began[vxd] helping him}[t-p-nq], and[j] {they[s] found[vxd] ways for him (to study)[inf] in school again}[t-p]. {He[s] was[x] chosen[dtn] (to speak)[inf] at a TEDGlobal talk in Arusha, Tanzania}[t-p]. {That[s] changed[vxd] his life}[t-p] {through the connections it helped him make and the donations he could[x] use for his family and his village}[e-r]. Later[l] {he[s] created[vxd] a second windmill and set[vxd] up more light bulbs and some solar systems}[t=p] {(His work)[s] let[vxd] his family pump water from the ground}[t-p]. {(The whole village)[s] came[vxd] to his house}[t-p] {(to get)[inf] water (to drink)[inf] and irrigate their fields}[e-r].

{(Kamkwamba’s hard work studying science books and building his first windmill)[s] was[x] a key to his success in life}[t-p].

{(William Kamkwamba)[s] became[vxd] a hero in his village}[t-p], {showing that if we have goals in life, we have (to do)[inf] everything to reach them}[extra]. {He[s] opened[vxd] a new way for the next generation in his village}[t-p]. {(Everyone who knows him there)[s] will[x] tell[v] their children about the young man who decided (to change)[inf] his life for the better}[t-n]. {Through hard work and teamwork}[f-r] {he[s] actually did[x]}[t-p-nq].
