{When you think of classic American road food  like hamburgers, french fries, and milkshakes,}[f] {do[x] you[s] see[v] any connection to democracy?}[t] {If you  have[x] ever heard the history of the original Shake Shack,}[f] {maybe[l] you[s] do[vxo].}[t] {A restaurant with fast food  and more,}[extra]  {(Shake Shack)[s] has[x] grown[dtn] in popularity so much that it[s] has[x] expanded}[t] {in New York City, where it started, in other cities in the U.S., and even abroad.}[e] 
{(The first Shake Shack)[s] was[x] built[dtn]}[t] {in Madison Square Park, near the famous Flatiron building.}[e] (Like other public parks in the city,)[f] {(Madison Square Park)[s] has[x] changed[dtn] a lot}[t] (over the years.)[e] {It[s] has[x] gone[dtn] through a period of ups and downs,}[t] but[j] {(businesses like Shake Shack)[s]  have[x]  had[dtn] a positive influence.}[t] {They[s] represent[vxo] the public-private partnerships that have[x] increased[dtn] in New York City’s parks.}[t] {Although you could[x] certainly find reasons (to criticize)[inf] these partnerships,}[f] {you[s] could[x]  also thank[v] them for making the parks cleaner and safer.}[t] {(Shake Shack)[s] is[x]  a good example of a private business that might[x] seem like it('s)[x] for rich people,}[t] but[j] {it also has[vxs] some lower-priced products.}[t] {As a matter of fact,}[l] {it[s] actually started[vxd] with a connection to democracy.}[t]
 
{(The origins of Shake Shack)[s] are[x] linked[dtn] to a partnership between its founder(, Danny Meyer,)[extra] and a Thai artist(, Navin Rawanchaikul.)[extra]}[t] {(The artist’s show “I[s] Love Taxi”)[s] was[x] a political statement about democracy as well as a fun work of art.}[t] {It[s] involved[vxd] taxi cabs painted with faces and other designs and a fully functioning hot dog cart.}[t]  {You[s] might[x] wonder[v] how this is[x]  connected to democracy.}[t] {As Danny Meyer  explained in an interview,}[f] {“The 2 most democratic things in the world are[x] hot dog carts and taxi cabs}[t] {because everyone in the world has[x] either been able to afford (to take)[inf] a taxi ride or had[x] (to be)[inf] the guy driving the taxi.}[e] {(Everyone in the world)[s] has[x] either been[dtn] able (to buy)[inf] a hot dog or had[dtn] (to be)[inf] the guy selling it.”}[t]
