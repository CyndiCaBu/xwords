{When you think of classic American road food  like hamburgers, french fries, and milkshakes}[f-t], {do[x] you[s] see[v] any connection to democracy}[t-n]? {If you  have[x] ever heard the history of the original Shake Shack}[f-cd], {maybe[l] you[s] do[vxo]}[t-n-nq]. {A restaurant with fast food  and more}[extra],  {(Shake Shack)[s] has[x] grown[dtn] in popularity so much that it[s] has[x] expanded}[t-b]. {It[s] has[vxs] many locations in New York (where it started)[extra], in other cities and states of the United States, and even abroad}[t-n].
 
{(The first Shake Shack)[s] was[x] built[dtn]}[t-n] {in Madison Square Park, near the famous Flatiron building in Manhattan}[e-p]. {Like other public parks in the city}[f-r], {(Madison Square Park)[s] has[x] changed[dtn] a lot}[t-b] {over the years}[e-t]. {It[s] has[x] gone[dtn] through ups and downs}[t-b]. {(Businesses like Shake Shack)[s] have[x] had[dtn] a positive influence}[t-b]. {They[s] represent[vxo] the public-private partnerships that have[x] increased in New York City’s parks}[t-n]. {Although you could[x] certainly find reasons (to criticize)[inf] these partnerships}[f-ct], {you[s] could[x]  also thank[v] them for making[ger] the parks cleaner and safer}[t-n]. {(Shake Shack)[s] is[x]  a good example of a private business that might[x] seem like it('s)[x] for rich people}[t-n], but[j] {it also has[vxs] some lower-priced products}[t-n]. {As a matter of fact}[l], {it[s] actually started[vxd] with a connection to democracy}[t-p].
 
{(The origins of Shake Shack)[s] are[x] linked[dtn] to a partnership between its founder, (Danny Meyer)[extra], and a Thai artist, (Navin Rawanchaikul)[extra]}[t-n]. {(The artist’s show “I Love Taxi”)[s] was[x] a political statement about democracy as well as a fun work of art}[t-p]. {It[s] involved[vxd] taxi cabs painted with faces and other designs and a fully functioning[ger] hot dog cart}[t-p]. 

{What('s)[x] the connection between hot dogs and democracy}[t-n-nq]? {As Danny Meyer  explained in an interview}[f-p], {“The 2 most democratic things in the world are[x] hot dog carts and taxi cabs}[t-n]. {Everyone in the world has[x] either been able (to afford)[inf] (to take)[inf] a taxi ride or had[x] (to be)[inf] the guy driving[ger] the taxi}[t-b]. {(Everyone in the world)[s] has[x] either been[dtn] able (to buy)[inf] a hot dog or had[dtn] (to be)[inf] the guy selling[ger] it.”}[t-b]

{Whether you agree with that or not}[f-cd], {if you[s] appreciate a successful business}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x]  want[v] (to learn)[inf] a little more about Shake Shack}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] people who look down on it}[t-n], {wondering[ger] why anyone would[x] pay so much money for a simple hamburger}[extra]. {Others[s] say[vxo] that you (can’t)[x] always get such a delicious burger in such a lovely setting}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] get[vxo] what you[s] pay for in terms of the quality of the ingredients}[t-n]. {If you[s] (don’t)[x] want hormones or antibiotics in your meat}[f-cd], {(Shake Shack)[s] could[x] be[v] a good place (to go)[inf]}[t-n]. {(The menu)[s] can[x] change[v]}[t-n] {depending on the location and the season}[e-cd], but[j] {you[s](’re)[x] almost guaranteed (to find)[inf] burgers and milkshakes}[t-n] {no matter where or when you go}[e-t].
