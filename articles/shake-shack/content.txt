{When you think of classic American road food  like hamburgers, french fries, and milkshakes,}[f] {do[x] you[s] see[v] any connection to democracy?}[f] {If you  have[x] ever heard the history of the original Shake Shack,}[f] {maybe you[s] do[vxo].}[t] {It[s](’s)[x]  a restaurant with fast food  and more.}[t]  {(Shake Shack)[s] has[x] grown[dtn] in popularity so much that it[s] has[x] expanded}[t] {in New York City,(where it started,)[extra] in other cities in the U.S., and even abroad.}[e] 
The first Shake Shack, pictured here, was[x] built in Madison Square Park, near the famous Flatiron building. Like other public parks in the city, Madison Square Park has[x] changed a lot over the years. It[s] has[x] gone through a period of ups and downs, but[j] businesses like Shake Shack  have[x]  had[x] a positive influence. They represent the public-private partnerships that have[x] increased in New York City’s parks over the last decade or so. Although you[s] could[x]  certainly find reasons to criticize these partnerships, you[s] could[x]  also thank them for making the parks cleaner and safer. Shake Shack is[x]  a good example of a private business that might[x] seem like it[s]’s for rich people but[j] it[s] has[x] some lower-priced products, too. As a matter of fact, it[s] actually started with a connection to democracy. 
The origins of Shake Shack are[x] linked to a partnership between its founder, Danny Meyer, and a Thai artist, Navin Rawanchaikul. The artist’s show “I[s] Love Taxi” was[x] a political statement about democracy as well as a fun work of art. It[s] involved taxi cabs painted with faces and other designs and a fully functioning hot dog cart.  You[s] might[x] wonder how this is[x]  connected to democracy. As Danny Meyer  explained in an interview, “The 2 most democratic things in the world are[x] hot dog carts and taxi cabs, because everyone in the world has[x] either been able to afford to take a taxi ride or had[x] to be the guy driving the taxi. And everyone in the world has[x] either been able to buy a hot dog or had[x] to be the guy selling it[s].” 
Whether you[s] agree with that or not, if you[s] appreciate a successful business you[s] might[x]  want to learn a little more about Shake Shack. There are[x] people who look down on it[s], wondering why anyone would[x]  pay so much money for a simple hamburger. Others say that you[s] can[x]’t always get such a delicious burger in such a lovely setting, and you[s] get what you[s] pay for in terms of the quality of the ingredients. If you[s] don’t want hormones or antibiotics in your meat, Shake Shack is[x]  a good place to go. The menu can[x]  change depending on the location and the season, but[j] you[s]’re almost guaranteed to find burgers and milkshakes no matter where or when you[s] go.
