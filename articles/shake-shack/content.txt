{When you think of classic American road food like hamburgers, french fries, and milkshakes}[f-t], {do[x] you[s] see[v] any connection to democracy}[t-n]? {If you have[x] ever heard the history of the original Shake Shack}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x]}[t-n-nq]. 

{A restaurant with fast food and more}[extra], {(Shake Shack)[s] has[vxs] locations in the United States and abroad}[t-n]. {It[s] started[vxd] in New York}[t-p], {in a park near the Flatiron building in Manhattan}[e-p].

{During a summer art exhibit in the park}[f-t], {(the Thai artist Navin Rawanchaikul)[s] used[vxd] images of old-fashioned New York taxis (to help)[inf] tell cabdrivers' stories}[t-p]. {(A model of a yellow cab with faces painted in the windows)[s] stood[vxd] on poles over a model of the city}[t-p]. {Called (I Heart Taxi)[title]}[extra], {(this art project)[s] also had[vxd] a hot dog cart with food provided by New York restaurateur Danny Meyer}[t-p].

{Meyer[s] claims[vxs] that Rawanchaikul's project was[x] a political statement about democracy as well as a fun work of art}[t-n]. 
{What[s]('s)[x] the connection?}[t-n-nq]? {As Meyer  explained in an interview}[f-p], “{The 2 most democratic things in the world are[x] hot dog carts and taxi cabs}[t-n]. {Everyone in the world has[x] either been able (to afford)[inf] (to take)[inf] a taxi ride or had[x] (to be)[inf] the guy driving[ger] the taxi}[t-b]. {(Everyone in the world)[s] has[x] either been[dtn] able (to buy)[inf] a hot dog or had[dtn] (to be)[inf] the guy selling[ger] it.}[t-b]”

{Whether you agree with that or not}[f-cd], {if you[s] appreciate a successful business}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x]  want[v] (to learn)[inf] a little more about Shake Shack}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] people who look down on it}[t-n], {wondering[ger] why anyone would[x] pay so much money for a simple hamburger}[extra]. {Others[s] say[vxo] that you (can’t)[x] always get such a delicious burger in such a lovely setting as Madison Square Park}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] get[vxo] what you[s] pay for in terms of the quality of the ingredients}[t-n]. {If you[s] (don’t)[x] want[v] hormones or antibiotics in your meat}[f-cd], {(Shake Shack)[s] could[x] be[v] a good place (to go)[inf]}[t-n]. {(The menu)[s] can[x] change[v]}[t-n] {depending[ger] on the location and the season}[e-cd], but[j] {you[s](’re)[x] almost guaranteed (to find)[inf] burgers and milkshakes}[t-n] {no matter where or when you go}[e-t].
