 {More than half a century ago,}[f] {(the Green Revolution)[s] transformed[vxd] much of the world,}[t] {doubling or even tripling agricultural output and bringing food security and greater prosperity to millions of families.}[extra]  {(The unsung heroes of that revolution)[s] were[x] agricultural extension (training) agents,}[t] {traveling by bicycle, motorbike or foot down rural dirt roads, carrying better farming practices and better lives with them.}[extra] {(These agents)[s] were[x] literally putting[v] Norman Borlaug's famous quote "Take it[s] to the farmer" into practice.}[t]
