{Leadership[s] involves[vxs] taking[ger] action and serving[ger] as an example to others}[t-n]. {(A leader)[s] can[x] help[v] motivate a group of people (to do)[inf] something and get along well while doing[ger] it}[t-n]. 

{We[s] can[x] show[v] leadership}[t-n] {at home, at work and in our communities}[e-p]. Likewise[l], {(companies and organizations)[s] can[x] lead[v] by setting[ger] examples and inspiring[ger] others}[t-n]. 

{(A leader)[s] can[x] change[v] how people think about something}[t-n]. {For instance}[l], {poverty[s] is[x] often seen[dtn] as inevitable}[t-n]. {Hunger[s] is[x] part of poverty}[t-n], but[j] {does[x] it[s] have[v] (to be)[inf]}[t-n-nq]? {Consider the people who grow our food}[t-n-nq], {the farmers}[extra]. {(The ones without a lot of land)[s] are[x] often poor}[t-n], but[j] {how can[x] farmers[s] go[v] hungry}[t-n-nq]?

 {(Thinking about these questions)[s] led[vxd] to the creation of the One Acre Fund}[t-p], {a non-profit organization focused on farmers}[extra]. {By using management lessons to work on a human problem}[f], {the One Acre Fund has[x] become[dtn] a leader in the struggle against extreme rural poverty}[t-n].

{(The term “fund” in the organization’s name)[s] refers[vxs] to a key service that hungry farmers were[x] missing[vg]}[t-n]: {credit}[extra].  {(A lack of cash or credit)[s] means[vxs] that farmers must[x] sell[v] before they can[x] buy[v]}[t-n]. {As a result}[l], {they[s] can[x] get[v] stuck paying[ger] higher prices}[t-n] {due to bad timing}[e]. {With credit}[f-r], {farmers[s] have[vxo] more freedom}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] buy[v] seeds and fertilizer}[t-n] {when the price is[x] right}[e-t]. 

{By joining[ger] the One Acre Fund}[f-r], {farmers[s] can[x] get[v] training[ger] as well as asset-based financing}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] become[v] field officers}[t-n] - {the people who  train other farmers, collect cash, and deliver seeds and fertilizer}[extra]. 
 
{(The One Acre Fund)[s] sees[vxs] farmers as leaders}[t-n]. {It[s] puts[vxs] farmers first and gives[vxs] them what no one can[x] take away}[t=n]: {knowledge}[extra].
