{Leadership[s] involves[vxs] taking action and serving as an example to others}[t-n]. {(A leader)[s] can[x] help[v] motivate a group of people (to do)[inf] something and get along well while doing it}[t-n]. 

{People[s] can[x] show[v] leadership}[t-n] {at home, at work and in our communities}[e-p]. Likewise[l], {(companies and organizations)[s] can[x] lead[v] by setting examples and inspiring others}[t-n]. {(The One Acre Fund)[s] is[x] a non-profit social enterprise that started from a simple question}[t-n]: {how can[x] farmers go hungry}[extra]? {Since then}[f-t], {it[s] has[x] been[dtn] leading the way (to help)[inf] end extreme poverty by putting farmers first}[t-b].

{(One Acre Fund farmers)[s] become[vxo] leaders themselves}[t-n], {training others and sharing what no one can[x] take away: knowledge}[extra]. {(One Acre farmer Jacqueline Nasonja)[s], (pictured here)[extra], is[x] one of these leaders}[t-n]. {(People in the One Acre Fund training department in Kenya)[s] wrote[vxd] the article below}[t-p].

{More than half a century ago}[f-t], {(the Green Revolution)[s] transformed[vxd] much of the world}[t-p], {doubling or even tripling agricultural output and bringing food security and greater prosperity to millions of families}[extra].  {(The unsung heroes of that revolution)[s] were[x] agricultural extension training agents}[t-p], {trainers traveling by bicycle, motorbike or foot down rural dirt roads, carrying better farming practices and better lives with them}[extra]. {(These agents)[s] were[x] literally putting[v] Norman Borlaug's famous quote "Take it[s] to the farmer" into practice}[t-p].

{Despite the success of the Green Revolution[vxd] in Asia and Latin America}[f-ct], {it[s] bypassed[vxd] much of sub-Saharan Africa}[t-p], {where many rural farmers continue (to use)[inf] the same agricultural practices their forefathers used a century or more ago}[extra].  Today[l] {(university-educated agricultural extension agents with motorbikes or cars)[s] continue[vxo] (to travel)[inf] down dirt roads doing incredible work}[t-n], but[j] {they[s] are[x] massively outnumbered[dtn] by the rural farmers who need them}[t-n]. 

{In 2006}[f-t], {(One Acre Fund founder Andrew Youn)[s] saw[vxd] this mismatch and proposed[vxd] a different approach}[t=p].  {He[s] realized[vxd] that in order (0to bring0)[inf] "Take it to the farmer" to the very last mile a dense network of trainers was[x] needed (to communicate)[inf] complex skills and knowledge quickly and efficiently}[t-p-nq].

{For this role}[f-r], {Andrew[s] envisioned[vxd] the One Acre Fund field officer}[t-p], {a person like Joy Khisa -- on the left in this photo}[extra].  {A farmer herself}[extra], {Joy[s] has[x] always lived[dtn] in the area of Kenya she serves}[t-b].  {She[s] has[vxs] no university degree, no white Land Rover, no large salary}[t-n].  Nonetheless[l], {Joy[s] works[vxs] with 154 families in her community}[t-n], {meeting them once a week all year round (to train)[inf] them on topics as diverse as new planting methods, the proper use of reusable sanitary pads, financial planning, and how (to maintain)[inf] your solar light}[extra].  {(Her impact and the impact of One Acre Fund Kenyaâ€™s 900 other field officers)[s] is[x] incredible}[t-n]. {(The average One Acre Fund farmer)[s] sees[vxs] approximately 50 percent more income than a similarly-situated non-One Acre Fund farmer}[t-n]. Moreover[l], {Joy[s] (isn't)[x] leaving[v]}[t-n]. {She[s] will[x] continue[v] (to work)[inf] in her community}[t-n], {meeting the 154 families she works with once a week, every week, for many years (to come)[inf]}[extra].
