{In the United States}[f-p], {(the second Monday in October)[s] is[x] a federal holiday}[t-n]. {That[s] means[vxs] public schools and other government institutions  are[x] closed}[t-n]. {(The holiday)[s] is[x] officially in honor of Christopher Columbus}[t-n], {a man who was[x] born in Italy in 1451}[extra]. {It[s]('s)[x] also a chance (to practice)[inf] critical thinking[ger]}[t-n], {especially the skill of considering[ger] different points of view}[extra]. {(What Columbus did[x] between his birth in Italy and his death in Spain about 50 years later)[s] is[x] what really matters}[t-n].

{For many Italian Americans and others}[f-r], {Columbus[s] was[x]a hero}[t-p]. {Like other European explorers of his era}[extra], {he[s] left[vxd] home (to learn)[inf] about other parts of the world and bring back riches and information for his sponsors}[t-p]. {Long before the internet and air travel}[f-t], {you[s] (couldn't)[x] really know[v] much about any place or people far from your own home}[t-p].  {You[s] could[x] only imagine[v] and listen[v] to stories from people who traveled by land}[t-p], {like traders}[extra].  {Without accurate maps}[extra], {(people on one continent)[s] (didn't)[x] even know[v] about different people on another}[t-p].

{There[s] was[x] debate and ignorance about the shape of our planet}[t-p]. {Did[x] (the world)[s] end[v] at the horizon}[t-p-nq]? {If you sailed a ship all the way out to that line where the water meets the sky}[f-cd], {would[x] you[s] fall[v] off the edge of the earth}[t-n-nq]? {These[s] were[x] just a few of the uncertainties that made travel so risky}[t-p] {over 5 centuries ago}[e-t]. {When people claim that Columbus was[x] a brave leader}[f-t], {this[s] might[x] be[v] partly what they have[x] in mind}[t-n].

{That[s]('s)[x] one way (to look)[inf] at Columbus}[t-n]: {an explorer who opened up a whole "new world" to Europe}[extra]. {He[s] (wasn't)[x] the first European (to arrive)[inf] in the Americas}[t-p-nq]. {(Other explorers)[s] had[x] crossed[v] the Atlantic from northern Europe about 500 years earlier}[t-p]. {Called Vikings, or Norsemen}[extra], {they[s] came[vxd] from the area we now call Scandinavia}[t-p]: {countries like Denmark, Norway and Sweden}[extra]. However[l], {while the Vikings ended up colonizing[ger] and changing[ger] parts of Europe}[f-ct], {(Columbus' journey)[s] led[vxd] Spain and other European countries (to colonize)[inf] and utterly transform the Americas}[t-p].

Ironically[l], {Columbus[s] was[x] actually looking[vg] for India}[t-p], {a source of valuable herbs and spices that (didn't)[x] grow in northern Europe}[extra]. {He[s] was[x] also hoping[vg] (to find)[inf] a shorter path to gold and other riches for his sponsors in Spain}[t-p]. {After a difficult journey full of storms, doubts, ill health and other trouble}[f-t], {(he and his crew)[s] landed[vxd] in the Caribbean}[t-p], {far away from their original destination}[extra]. Confused[extra], {they[s] referred[vxd] to the people there as "Indians"}[t-p].

Sadly, {racism[s] blinded[vxd] Columbus and his fellow Europeans}[t-p]. {They[s] may[x] not have[v] recognized the islanders as fellow humans}[t-p]. {Without a way (to communicate)[inf] clearly}[f-r], {they[s] (couldn't)[x] ask questions about each other's families, manners, clothing, and more}[t-p], {questions that would[x] help[v] them see their points in common}[extra]. Instead[l], {(the Europeans and the native Caribbeans)[s] became[vxd] enemies}[t-p]. {(Exploitation, territorial invasion and even genocide)[s] came[vxd] next}[t-p] - {with disastrous consequences}[extra]. 

{(Those who still honor Columbus)[s] say[vxo] he discovered the Americas}[t-n]. {They[s] call[vxo] the October holiday Columbus Day}[t-n]. {(Those who see the connection between his voyage and suffering)[s] have[vxo] a different perspective}[t-n]. {(One elderly man from the Dominican Republic)[s] referred[vxd] to Columbus as an assassin and a traitor}[t-p]. {He[s]('s[x] not the only person who feels that way}[t-n-nq]. {(More and more people)[s] are[x] choosing[vg] (to refer)[inf] to the same day in October as Indigenous People's Day}[t-n].

Perhaps[l] {we[s] (don't)[x] have[v] enough evidence (to verify)[inf] reports of Columbus and/or his crew demanding[ger] gold and committing[ger] atrocities}[t-n-nq], but[j] {we[s] do[x] know[v] that millions and millions of native people died}[t-p] {after his arrival}[e-t]. {Violence[s] was[x] one factor}[t-p](;)[j] {disease[s] was[x] another}[t-p]. {(Living[ger] in close contact with animals)[s], (even sleeping[ger] near them for warmth)[extra], had[x] helped[v] Europeans develop resistance to germs that devastated people born and raised far away}[t-p]. {(Neither the Europeans nor the indigenous Caribbeans)[s] knew[vxd] how infection worked}[t-p]. {Germs[s] were[x] like a secret weapon}[t-p], {unknown to both sides}[extra].

The more we look into history (to compare)[inf] different points of view, the more interesting questions {we[s] can[x] ask[v]}[t-n]. {Did[x] (either side)[s], (the Europeans or the native Caribbeans)[extra], respect[v] what we now call human rights in their own societies}[t-p-nq]? {Is[x] it[s] fair (to use)[inf] our modern sense of justice when we look at the past}[t-n-nq]? {What[s] can[x] change}[t-n-nq] {depending[ger] on which perspective we take}[e-cd]?
