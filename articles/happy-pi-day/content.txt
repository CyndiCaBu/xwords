You don’t have to love math to appreciate Pi Day. The enthusiasm of math lovers can brighten anyone&#8217;s day on March 14th every year. There are plenty of ways to celebrate the number 3.14159265&#8230;etc., especially by measuring circles and doing some division.
In some places, you can solve math problems in exchange for a piece of pizza. You might never actually call it pizza pie, but it is a salty type of pie. If you would rather have something sweet, you can celebrate 3.14 with a fruit pie.
At the W. Rogowski farm stand on the Pi Day of the century, 3.1415, there were lots of fresh ingredients people could buy to make a veggie pie, better known as a quiche. It was raining off and on most of the day, but anyone who didn’t mind the rain could hang out and talk about math with one of these guys, a real math expert. He had a great pi shirt showing not only the number 3.1415 but the fascinating way that number is part of any circle, no matter how big or how small.
According to the MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics, pi is &#8220;the relationship between the distance around a circle and the distance through it.&#8221; Test it for yourself. If you start measuring and doing the math, you will find the result to be 3.14159265&#8230;etc. every time. Happy Pi Day!
