{You[s] (donâ€™t)[x] have[v] (to love)[inf] math (to appreciate)[inf] Pi Day}[t-n]. {(The enthusiasm of math lovers)[s] can[x] brighten[v] anyone's day}[t-n] {on March 14th every year}[e-t].

{Pi[s] is[x] the relationship between the distance around a circle and the distance through it}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] test[v] it for yourself}[t-n]. {Choose[v] anything round and measure[v] its circumference and its diameter}[t-n-nq]. Then[l] {divide[v] the circumference by the diameter}[t-n-nq]. {If the result is[x] not 3.14159265 etc.}[f-cd], {you[s] may[x] need[v] (to check)[inf] your measurmements and your calculations}[t-n-nq]. {(The whole point of pi)[s] is[x] that it (doesn't)[x] change[v]}[t-n];[j] {it[s]('s)[x] called a mathematical constant}[t-n]. {Since pi starts with 3.14}[f-r], {(Pi Day)[s] is[x] on March 14th}[t-n].

{On the Pi Day of the century}[f-t], (3.14.15)[extra], {(the W. Rogowski farm stand)[s] had[vxd] a few pi-celebrating options}[t-p]. {There[s] were[x] lots of fresh ingredients (to make)[inf] a veggie pie}[t-p], {better known as a quiche}[extra]. {It[s] was[x] raining[vg] off and on most of the day}[t-p], but[j] {(these guys)[s] were[x] still working[vg]}[t-p]. {One[s] was[x] a real math expert}[t-p]. {He[s] was[x] wearing[vg] a  pi shirt showing[ger] not only the number 3.1415 but also the fascinating way that pi is[x] part of any circle}[t-p], {no matter how big or how small}[extra].
 
{(Measuring[ger] circles and doing[ger] some division)[s] gives[vxs] hands-on practice with pi}[t-n]. {Food[s] adds[vxs] a fun element}[t-n]. {In some places}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] solve[v] math problems in exchange for a piece of pizza}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] never actually call[v] it pizza pie}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] is[x] a salty type of pie}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] also celebrate[v] 3.14 with a fruit pie}[t-n] {if you[s] would[x] rather have[v] something sweet}[e-cd]. 

Happy Pi Day {if today is[x] March 14th}[e-cd], and happy Tau Day {if it('s)[x] June 28th}[e-cd]!
