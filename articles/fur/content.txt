 How do  you feel about fur? If you have any fur-bearing pets around, how do you think they feel about it? How does  their fur feel to you when you touch it?
Regardless of how you respond to these questions, if you really analyze the topic, you can probably understand more than one point of view about fur. From the animals' perspective, it’s as natural as our hair is  to us. It keeps them warm and it might be part of what makes them attractive. Unfortunately for the animals, since fur is well-known for its warmth, hunters and trappers have  killed them to get it for centuries. In cold places where people don’t have many other options, that might  make sense. However, when fur is just used for fashion, doesn’t that show a lack of creativity and compassion? There are  so many other options, including both natural fibers and the fake stuff that probably doesn’t benefit the earth very much.
The photo above was  taken outside a major department store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan. There was  a group of  people protesting the use of fur for fashion. I don’t know if they were specifically targeting that store, but that would make sense. They were  holding a variety of signs to try to help others understand the cruelty of killing an animal for its fur. To me, the most convincing sign was a simple message with an image of a small furry animal. It read, “She needs her fur coat.” In other words, the animal really does need it; do  we?
If you say that you don’t need it but you want it, would  you be willing to use fur from the animals that most humans would  rather not protect, like rats? Hmm…
