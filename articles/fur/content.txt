{Regardless of how you[s] respond to these questions,}[l] {if you[s] really analyze the topic,}[f] {you[s] can[x] probably understand[v] more than one point of view about fur.}[t] {From the animals' perspective,}[f] {it[s]’s as natural as our hair is[x]  to us.}[t] {It[s] keeps[vxs] them warm and it[s] might[x] be[v] part of what makes them attractive to other animals.}[t] 

{Unfortunately[l] for the animals,}[f] {since fur is[x] well-known for its warmth,}[f] {(hunters and trappers)[s] have[x]  killed[dtn] them (to get)[inf] it[s] for centuries.}[t] (In cold places where people don’t have[x] many other options,)[f] {that might[x]  make[v] sense.}[t] However[l], {when fur is[x] just used for fashion,}[f] {doesn’t that show a lack of creativity and compassion?}[t] {There[s] are[x]  so many other options,}[t] {including both natural and synthetic fibers.}[t]
