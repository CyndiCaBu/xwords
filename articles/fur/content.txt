{How do[x] you[s] feel[v] about fur}[t-n-nq]? {If you have[x] any fur-bearing pets around}[f-cd], {how do[x] you[s] think[v] they feel about it}[t-n-nq]? {How does[x] (their fur)[s] feel[v] to you}[t-n-nq] {when you touch it}[e-t]?

{Regardless of how you respond to these questions}[l], {if you really analyze the topic}[f-cd], {you[s] can[x] probably understand[v] more than one point of view about fur}[t-n]. {From the animals' perspective}[f-r], {it[s](’s)[x] as natural as our hair is[x] to us}[t-n]. {It[s] keeps[vxs] them warm}[t-n], and[j] {it[s] might[x] be[v] part of what makes them attractive to other animals}[t-n]. 

{Unfortunately for the animals}[l], {(hunters and trappers)[s] have[x]  killed[dtn] them}[t-b] {for centuries}[t] {(to get)[inf] their fur}[e-r]. {In cold places where people don’t have[x] many other options}[f-p], {that[s] might[x]  make[v] sense}[t-n-nq]. However[l], {when fur is[x] just used for fashion}[f-t], {(doesn’t)[x] that[s] show[v] a lack of creativity and compassion}[t-n-nq]? {There[s] are[x] so many other options}[t-n], {including both natural and synthetic fibers}[extra].

{(The photo above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn]}[t-p] {outside a major department store in Manhattan}[e-p]. {People[s] were[x] protesting[vg] against the use of fur for fashion}[t-p]. {They[s] were[x] holding[vg] a variety of signs (to try)[inf] (to help)[inf] others understand the cruelty of killing[ger] an animal for its fur}[t-p]. 

{Perhaps}[l] {(the most convincing sign)[s] was[x] a simple message with an image of a small furry animal}[t-p]. {It[s] read[vxd],}[t] {“She[s] needs[vxs] her fur coat.”}[t-n]. {It[s] was[x] convincing}[t-p] {because it was[x] true}[e-r]. {(Animals)[s] really do[x] need[v] their fur}[t-n] - but[j] { do[x] we[s]}[t-n-nq]?

{You[s] could[x] argue[v] that you (don’t)[x] need fur, but you want it}[t-n]. OK. {Would[x] you[s] be[v] willing (to use)[inf] fur from the animals that most humans would[x] rather not protect}[t-n], {like mice and rats}[extra]?
