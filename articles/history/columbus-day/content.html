<p>In the United States, the second Monday in October <span class="xw is_class">is</span> a federal holiday. That means public schools and other government institutions  <span class="xw are_class">are</span> closed. The holiday <span class="xw is_class">is</span> officially in honor of Christopher Columbus, a man who <span class="xw was_class">was</span> born in Italy in 1451. It<span class="xw is_class">'s</span> also a chance to practice critical thinking, especially the skill of considering different points of view. What Columbus <span class="xw did_class">did</span> between his birth in Italy and his death in Spain about 50 years later <span class="xw is_class">is</span> what really matters.</p>
<p>For many Italian Americans and others, Columbus <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a hero. Like other European explorers of his era, he left home to learn about other parts of the world and bring back riches and information for his sponsors. Long before the internet and our ability to fly far away for a relatively low economic cost, you <span class="xw couldnt_class">couldn't</span> really know much about any place or people far from your own home; you <span class="xw could_class">could</span> only imagine and listen to stories from traders who traveled by land. Without accurate maps, people on one continent <span class="xw did_class">didn't</span> even know about different people on another.</p>
<p>There <span class="xw was_class">was</span> debate and ignorance about the shape of our planet. <span class="xw did_class">Did</span> the world end at the horizon? If you sailed a ship all the way out to that line where the water meets the sky, <span class="xw would_class">would</span> you fall off the edge of the earth? These <span class="xw were_class">were</span> just a few of the uncertainties that made travel so risky over 5 centuries ago. When people claim that Columbus <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a brave leader, this <span class="xw might_class">might</span> be partly what they <span class="xw have_class">have</span> in mind.</p>
<p>That<span class="xw is_class">'s</span> one way to look at Columbus: an explorer who opened up a whole "new world" to Europe. He <span class="xw was_class">wasn't</span> the first European to arrive in the Americas; other explorers <span class="xw had_class">had</span> crossed the Atlantic from northern Europe about 500 years earlier. Called Vikings, or Norsemen, they came from the area we now call Scandinavia (countries like Denmark, Norway and Sweden). However, while the Vikings ended up colonizing and changing parts of Europe, Columbus' journey led Spain and other European countries to colonize and utterly transform the Americas.</p>
<p>Ironically, Columbus <span class="xw was_class">was</span> actually looking for India, a source of valuable herbs and spices that <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> grow in northern Europe. He <span class="xw was_class">was</span> hoping to find a shorter path to gold and other riches for his sponsors in Spain. However, after a difficult journey full of storms, doubts, ill health and other trouble, he and his crew landed in the Caribbean. Still confused, they referred to the people there as "Indians" but they <span class="xw may_class">may</span> not have even seen them as fully human. Neither group understood the other; they lacked the appreciation of diversity that helps people of different cultures live together today. Without a way to communicate clearly and ask questions about each other's families, manners, clothing, and more, the Europeans and the native Caribbeans <span class="xw did_class">did</span> not get along well at all, to say the least.</p>
<p>Those who still honor Columbus say he discovered the Americas when he <span class="xw was_class">was</span> probably expecting more ocean and found a continent instead. Those who see the connection between his voyage and the subsequent disasters of exploitation, territorial invasion and even genocide <span class="xw may_class">may</span> have a different perspective. In the words of an elderly man from the Dominican Republic, "Columbus <span class="xw was_class">was</span> an assassin and a traitor!" Perhaps we <span class="xw dont_class">don't</span> have enough evidence to verify stories about Columbus and/or his crew demanding gold and committing atrocities, but we <span class="xw do_class">do</span> know that millions and millions of native people died. Violence <span class="xw was_class">was</span> one factor; disease <span class="xw was_class">was</span> another. Living in close contact with animals, even sleeping near them for warmth, <span class="xw had_class">had</span> helped Europeans develop resistance to germs that devastated people born and raised far away.</p>
<p><span class="xw did_class">Did</span> either side, the Europeans or the native Caribbeans, respect what we now call human rights in their own societies? <span class="xw is_class">Is</span> it fair to use our modern sense of justice when we look at the past?</p>
<p>In 2015, a difficult year for human rights, the activist Shaun King shared his point of view right before Columbus Day: "<span class="xw dont_class">Don't</span> you dare celebrate anything related to Christopher Columbus. He discovered nothing and <span class="xw did_class">didn't</span> even end up where he intended." What <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you think? With more information from different sources, <span class="xw have_class">have</span> you ever changed your perspective on history?</p>
