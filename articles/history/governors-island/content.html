Governors Island <span class="xw is_class">is</span> a small island in New York Harbor, very close to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> inhabited by American Indians of the Lenape tribe first and later by various European groups after the Dutch arrived there in the 1620s. For a while, it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> used by the British, who gave it the name we use today. Even though it <span class="xw should_class">should</span> be possessive, because the original British idea <span class="xw was_class">was</span> that the island <span class="xw was_class">was</span> for their royal governors, we <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> use the apostrophe anymore. At some point in history it just got lost; most people probably <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> miss it.
</p>
<p>
During the American Revolution, New York <span class="xw was_class">was</span> occupied by the British. George Washington and his army <span class="xw had_class">had</span> tried to capture Governors Island for the colonists, but the British won that particular battle. They occupied some of the forts that <span class="xw were_class">were</span> built to protect the coastline, until they eventually surrendered in 1783.
</p>
<p>
Some of the forts <span class="xw were_class">were</span> renovated after the war, including two buildings  that you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> visit if you go to the island nowadays. One <span class="xw is_class">is</span> called Fort Jay and the other <span class="xw is_class">is</span> known as Castle Williams, due to its shape and style. The National Park Service offers tours of the latter. If it<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> not too crowded, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> walk around the exhibits on the ground level by yourself. If you <span class="xw would_class">would</span> like to take a tour of the roof and the interior of the castle, you <span class="xw have_class">have</span> to get a free ticket from the desk at the castle. Castle Williams closes a little earlier than the rest of the island, so you <span class="xw should_class">should</span> plan accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Fort Jay <span class="xw is_class">is</span> near the Brooklyn side of Governors Island and you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> walk around it by yourself. Like Castle Williams, it gives you a sense of the history of the island and the way wars <span class="xw have_class">have</span> changed over the centuries, without losing any of their horror. There <span class="xw are_class">are</span> a few cannons at various positions around Fort Jay and some cannonballs, too. They <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> look like they’re the right size for the cannons, but they still help you imagine how awful it <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be to fight with them or against then.
</p>
<p>
No matter what side you<span class="xw re_class">’re</span> on, war involves suffering. At Governors Island you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> think about that if you focus on the history, but you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> also spend your day enjoying all the trees and open space. It<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> up to you!
