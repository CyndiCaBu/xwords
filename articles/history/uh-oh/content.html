<p>One morning in late summer, my friend and I took a ferry from lower Manhattan to Governors Island. When we arrived at the island, we walked toward Brooklyn because we <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> want to go in the same direction as most of the other people from the ferry. We <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span>  have anything against them, of course; we just prefer to avoid a crowd when we <span class="xw can_class">can</span>.</p>
<p>After taking a few pictures of the Manhattan skyline and the bridges across the East River, we walked over to the Brooklyn side of the island.  Near the ferry that goes to downtown Brooklyn, there<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> an open-air museum on a small pier. It <span class="xw has_class">has</span> a few interactive exhibits with information about local history and environmental issues related to the river. You <span class="xw can_class">can</span>  turn a handle to generate electricity and play audio interviews with interesting people. My friend and I spent a few minutes listening to a young student talk about a project to revive oysters in local waterways, and then we each wandered around looking at different things.</p>
<p>It <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  a beautiful sunny morning and the wind <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  blowing. I <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  wearing a hat to protect my skin and my eyes so that the bright sun <span class="xw wouldnt_class">wouldn’t</span>  give me a headache from squinting. I <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  busy looking at something and I <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasn’t</span>  paying attention to my hat when suddenly the wind blew harder. As you <span class="xw can_class">can</span>  see from the picture, my hat flew straight to the water.  I <span class="xw had_class">had</span>  bought it in Haiti and worn it all over, from Brazil to Chicago. It fit me well, so I really wanted to get it back. My friend <span class="xw had_class">had</span>  walked to the end of the pier to look at something else, and although he wanted to help, there <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  nothing we <span class="xw could_class">could</span>  do. We looked around for a pole or a long stick to try to pull it out, and then I checked to see if anyone <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  in a kayak nearby but we <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span>  find a solution. I simply <span class="xw had_class">had</span>  to let go of my attachment to my hat, and to my feeling of guilt for dumping something in the river.</p>
<p>The irony <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  that my hat blew off when I <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  playing with an exhibit about the garbage people used to throw in the river when it <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  used as a dump. Someone <span class="xw had_class">had</span>  collected trash from the past and put it in a tube that you <span class="xw could_class">could</span>  turn and read about. There <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  an old carrot, a horses’ hoof from the days when horses <span class="xw were_class">were</span>  more common in the city than cars, and other samples of unwanted things from the past.</p>
<p>I wonder who <span class="xw might_class">might</span>  find my hat in the future, if anyone, to put in another display of the way 21st century humans <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span>  respect their waterways. Since it <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  made of cotton, maybe it <span class="xw will_class">will</span>  disintegrate in a few years and no one <span class="xw will_class">will</span>  find it. I hope so, anyway.</p>
