{Raquel[s] stood[vxd] in the garden looking at her wrist and trying hard not (to scratch)[inf] it again}[t-p]. {(A rash)[s] was[x] already forming[v] on her skin}[t-p], and {it[s] itched[vxd] incredibly}[t-p]. {She[s] recognized[vxd] it as an allergic reaction to poison ivy}[t-p], {a common plant in her area}[extra].

{Although she was[x] wearing[v] gloves (to protect)[inf] her hands and sunscreen (to protect)[inf] her skin}[f-ct], {she[s] realized[vxd] her mistake}[t-p] {as soon as she felt that itch}[e-t]. {She[s] should[x] have[v] worn long sleeves and paid more attention to the plants she was[x] pulling[v] out of the garden}[t-p]. 

{Raquel[s] knew[vxd] how (to identify)[inf] poison ivy by looking for three leaves with a particular shape}[t-p]. {She[s] knew[vxd] the plant had[x] an oil that could[x] cause[v] serious reactions}[t-p], {from itchy skin to severe blisters and even trouble breathing}[extra]. 

{She[s] (hadn't)[x] seen[v] poison ivy in the garden}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] recognized[vxd] her body's response to it}[t-p]. {As soon as she felt it starting}[f-t], {she[s] washed[vxd] her skin with soap and water}[t-p], carefully[extra]. {She[s] (couldn’t)[x] see[v] any oil on her wrist}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] knew[vxd] it was[x] there}[t-p], and[j] {she[s] (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to spread)[inf] it}[t-p].

{Over the next few hours}[f-t], {(little blisters)[s] formed[vxd] on Raquel’s wrist and forearm}[t-p]. {She[s] asked[vxd] her friends (to tie)[inf] her hands (to prevent)[inf] her from scratching her skin}[t-p], but[j] {they had[x] other ideas}[t-p]. {One[s] recommended[vxd] making a homemade anti-itch lotion from oatmeal}[t-p]. {Another[s] suggested[vxd] buying calamine lotion from the pharmacy}[t-p].  

Meanwhile[l], {Raquel[s] tried[vxd] (to focus)[inf] on something (to distract)[inf] her mind from the itch}[t-p]. First[l] {she[s] tried[vxd] (to remember)[inf] everything she knew about poison ivy}[t-p]. {It[s](’s)[x] native to North America}[t-p]. {(The leaves)[s] grow[v] in groups of three}[t-n], {sometimes with sharp edges like a saw}[extra]. {They[s]('re)[x] often glossy}[t-n], and[j] {(new leaves)[s] can[x] look[v] somewhat red but mostly green}[t-n]. {In the fall}[f-t], {(poison ivy)[s] turns[vxs] yellow first and then bright red}[t-n]. 

{Raquel[s] turned[vxd] her attention to other plants in those colors}[t-p] - {flowers like tulips and carnations}[extra]. {She[s] tried[vxd] (to think)[inf] of others}[t-p]: {peppers, tomatoes  - anything but[j] poison ivy, anything (to take)[inf] her mind off the terrible itch}[extra].
