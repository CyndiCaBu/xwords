<p> How <span class="xw do_class">do</span>  you feel about fur? If you <span class="xw have_class">have</span> any fur-bearing pets around, how <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you think they feel about it? How <span class="xw does_class">does</span>  their fur feel to you when you touch it?</p>
<p>Regardless of how you respond to these questions, if you really analyze the topic, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> probably understand more than one point of view about fur. From the animals' perspective, it<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> as natural as our hair <span class="xw is_class">is</span>  to us. It keeps them warm and it <span class="xw might_class">might</span> be part of what makes them attractive. Unfortunately for the animals, since fur <span class="xw is_class">is</span> well-known for its warmth, hunters and trappers <span class="xw have_class">have</span>  killed them to get it for centuries. In cold places where people <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> have many other options, that <span class="xw might_class">might</span>  make sense. However, when fur <span class="xw is_class">is</span> just used for fashion, <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> that show a lack of creativity and compassion? There <span class="xw are_class">are</span>  so many other options, including both natural fibers and the fake stuff that probably <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> benefit the earth very much.</p>
<p>The photo above <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  taken outside a major department store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan. There <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  a group of  people protesting the use of fur for fashion. I <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> know if they <span class="xw were_class">were</span> specifically targeting that store, but that <span class="xw would_class">would</span> make sense. They <span class="xw were_class">were</span>  holding a variety of signs to try to help others understand the cruelty of killing an animal for its fur. To me, the most convincing sign <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a simple message with an image of a small furry animal. It read, “She needs <strong>her</strong> fur coat.” In other words, the animal really <span class="xw does_class">does</span> need it; <span class="xw do_class">do</span>  we?</p>
<p>If you say that you <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> need it but you want it, <span class="xw would_class">would</span>  you be willing to use fur from the animals that most humans <span class="xw would_class">would</span>  rather not protect, like rats? Hmm…</p>
