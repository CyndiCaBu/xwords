<p><span class="xw have_class">Have</span> you ever stood next to someone walking on stilts? Better yet, <span class="xw have_class">have</span> you ever tried to walk on stilts yourself? It <span class="xw might_class">might</span> look fun, but it probably <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> look easy. You need to balance carefully and you <span class="xw cant_class">can’t</span> be afraid to take a risk, because when you take your first steps walking on stilts, you know there<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> a chance you <span class="xw could_class">could</span> fall.</p>
<p>Why <span class="xw do_class">do</span> people walk on stilts, anyway? If you<span class="xw ve_class">’ve </span> ever seen stilt walkers at a parade or a festival, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> probably think of a few  different answers. Consider the perspective of someone looking down on everyone and everything else from several feet higher. Look at everyone in the picture here, which <span class="xw was_class">was</span> taken at the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn. The people walking on the ground only come up to the feet of most of the stilt walkers. They <span class="xw could_class">could</span> look into the windows of the huge truck, but the stilt walkers <span class="xw can_class">can</span> see right over the top of it. Their height gives them an advantage; it commands respect and shows power.</p>
<p>What <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you think about the styles and postures of the different stilt walkers in this particular photo?  The one in the center looks young and not nearly as strong as the muscular man behind him, but the stilts still give him some authority. The guy on the far right photographer <span class="xw is_class">is</span> smiling, while the one on the far left looks like he<span class="xw s_class">’s </span> trying to scare or tease the crowd. Some of the stilt walkers <span class="xw are_class">are</span> coming towards the photographer, filmmaker Naheem Adio, while others <span class="xw are_class">are</span> walking the other way. Imagine being right there with them. What <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you think happened next?</p>
