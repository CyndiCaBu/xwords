<p> While we <span class="xw were_class">were</span>  walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park on a beautiful weekend in 2012, we noticed a few couples posing for wedding photos. We stopped to look at them for a minute, and it quickly became clear that we <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> share the same interest. One of us <span class="xw was_class">was</span> busy watching the couples laugh and smile for the cameras, while the other <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  focused on the car that <span class="xw was_class">was</span> waiting nearby. We thought it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> either a Bentley or a Rolls Royce, but we really <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> know for sure. Other people who <span class="xw were_class">were</span> walking by stopped to admire it, too. Even in a city with quite a few millionaires, we <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span>  see a classic luxury car like this very often.</p>
<p>The funny part <span class="xw was_class">was</span> when the bride and groom tried to get in the car. Holding a bouquet of flowers and trying to fit layers of fabric in at the same time <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> look easy. The bride <span class="xw was_class">was</span> probably trying not to get the dress dirty or wrinkled, but the skirt kept popping out of the open door. The groom <span class="xw was_class">was</span> trying to help, although there really <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasn’t</span>  much he <span class="xw could_class">could</span> do. Anyway, that gave everyone another chance to appreciate the car. A few minutes later they drove away, hopefully to a happy life together.</p>
