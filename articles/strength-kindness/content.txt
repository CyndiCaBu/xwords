{(Being[ger] kind to yourself and others)[s] can[x] increase[v] your well-being[ger]}[t-n]. {That[s] is[x] powerful information (to keep)[inf] in mind}[t-n], {especially when you('re)[x] having[vg] a hard time or feeling[vg] bored}[extra]. {Instead of letting[ger] yourself focus on negative feelings}[f-ct], {look[vxo] around}[t-n-nq]. {Think[vxo] about what you could[x] do (to show)[inf] kindness to someone}[t-n], {even a stranger in a spontaneous way}[extra]. Perhaps[l] {you[s] could[x] find[v] a way (to treat)[inf] yourself more kindly}[t-n], too[extra]. {Notice what happens next}[t-n-nq]. {What effect does[x] kindness[s] have[v] on your mood}[t-n-nq]?

{Kindness[s] often helps[vxs] people feel better}[t-n], and[j] {that[s] includes[vxs] both the person who showed kindness and the other person}[t-n]. {In the story below}[f-p], {kindness[s] was[x] one of several strengths that a group of friends shared}[t-p]. {Weijie Tang}[s], {a Chinese-American college graduate}[extra], {wrote[vxd] this story in his own voice}[t-p] - {back when he was[x] taking basic English classes to prepare for college}[extra]. 

{(The story)[s] happened[vxd]}[t-p] {just a few years ago}[e-t]. {I[s] was[x] the leader of our traveling team}[t-p] {during that time}[e-t]. {When we met this stray puppy}[f-t], {she[s] followed[vxd] our cycling team for about 10 miles}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] incredible}[t-p]! {When we arrived at a hostel}[f-t], {she[s] was[x] still following[vg] our team and just stayed[vxd] at our door overnight}[t=p]. 

{(That poor dog)[s] had[vxd] an eye infection and looked[vxd] so dirty}[t=p]. {Although some local people said she was[x] a very clever stray puppy}[f], {(none of them)[s] were[x] willing (to take)[inf] care of her}[t-p]. Finally[l], {we[s] decided[vxd] (to travel)[inf] with the dog}[t-p]. 

{To make room for her}[f], {I[s] offered[vxd] to take some heavy luggage that belonged to my friend}[t-p], Lily[extra]. Then[l] {Lily[s] put[vxd] the dog on her bicycle}[t-p]. {Because we (didn't)[x] have[v] a cage}[f-r], {we just put her in the washbasin}[t-p]. Fortunately[l], {(my other friend)[s] was[x] a doctor}[t-p]. {He[s] bought[vxd] some medicine (to treat)[inf] the puppy's eye infection}[t-p]. {I[s] made[vxd] a simple cage for her out of instant noodle boxes and rope}[t-p]. {Because we[s] were[x] just staying[vg] in a small village in Tibet}[f-r], {we[s] could[x] not buy[v] a cage}[t-p]. Meanwhile[l], {I[s] gave[vxd] the puppy a new name}[t-p]: {Sasa}[extra].

{(Our cycling team)[s] kept[vxd] going[ger] through the mountains with our newest member riding[ger] in her box}[t-p], {on the back of Lily's bike}[extra]. {Whenever we rode very slowly}[f-t], {Sasa[s] would[x] get[v] down and follow[v] us}[t-p]. {Like us}[f-r], {Sasa[s] saw[vxd] a lot of beautiful scenery and traveled[vxd] around Tibet}[t=p].  {She[s] always seemed[vxd] sensible and intelligent}[t-p]. 

{At times}[l], {like at an altitude of about 4,800 meters on a mountain in Tibet}[extra], {it[s] was[x] quite cold}[t-p]. Sometimes[l] {Sasa[s] would[x] be[v] freezing[ger]}[t-p] {when the weather was[x] bad}[e-t]. {We[s] would[x] stop[v] for about half an hour (to take)[inf] a break from the rain}[t-p]. {Sasa[s] always gave[vxd] us more fun}[t-p] {while we rested}[e-t].

Finally[l], {(our traveling team)[s] arrived[vxd] at the capital of Tibet}[t-p], Lhasa[extra]. {(This place)[s] is[x] very well known[dtn]}[t-n] {in China}[e-p], {like the Statue of Liberty in the USA}[extra]. {We[s] took[vxd] pictures with Sasa}[t-p] {outside the most well known building in Tibet}[e-p], {the Potala Palace}[extra].

Eventually[l], {I[s] had[vxd] (to leave)[inf]}[t-p], making[ger] a long journey back to my hometown[extra]. {I[s] (couldn't)[x] take[v] a pet on the train or plane}[t-p] {in China}[e-p]. Luckily[l], {(a temple of Lamaism)[s] promised[vxd] that they would[x] adopt[v] Sasa}[t-p]. {We[s] just gave[vxd] her a bath and cleaned[vxd] her up}[t=p] {before saying[ger] good-bye}[e]. {During that time}[f-t], {I[s] felt[vxd] like I was[x] a failure for helping Sasa and then abandoning her}[t-p]!

{Before leaving[ger] China and coming[ger] to the United States}[f-t], {I[s] flew[vxd] to Lhasa (to see)[inf] Sasa one more time}[t-p]. {I[s] feel[vxo] like she[s] is[x] part of my family}[t-n], and[j] {I[s] miss[vxo] her so much}[t-n] {as I write this}[e-t]. Nevertheless[l], {I[s]('m)[x] glad (to say)[inf] that she is[x] still healthy and happy}[t-n].
