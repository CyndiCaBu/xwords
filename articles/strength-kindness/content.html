You can increase your well-being by showing kindness. Just keeping that in mind can be a powerful tool. When you&#8216;re having a hard time or feeling bored, instead of letting yourself focus on negative feelings, look around. Think about what you could do to show kindness to someone else, even a stranger. Perhaps you could find a way to treat yourself more kindly. Try to notice what happens next. What effect does kindness have on your mood?Kindness may be one of those simple steps we can all take to make the world better, moment by moment. Sometimes we find ourselves showing it without even realizing it; kindness comes from our hearts. Here&#8216;s a story about it from a young man who loves to ride his bike long distances, WeiJie Tang. He told it in his own words and the pictures are his, too.
The story happened just two years ago. I was the team leader of our traveling team during that time. When we met this stray puppy, she followed our cycling team for about 10 miles. It was incredible!When we arrived at the hostel, she was still following our team and just stayed at our door overnight. She had an eye disease and looked so dirty. Some local people said she was a very clever stray puppy, but nobody was willing to take care of her.Finally, we decided to travel with the dog. I took care of some heavy luggage that belonged to my friend, Lily. Then Lily put the dog on her bicycle. Because we didn&#8217;t have a cage, we just put the puppy in the washbasin.Fortunately, my other friend was a doctor. He bought some medicine to treat the puppy&#8217;s eye disease. I made a simple cage for her, out of instant noodle boxes and rope. Because we were just staying in a small village in Tibet, we could not buy a cage. Meanwhile, I gave the puppy a new name &#8212; Sasa.
Our cycling team kept going through the mountains with our newest member riding in her box, on the back of Lily&#8217;s bike.If we rode very slowly, Sasa would get down and follow us.This photograph was taken on a very high mountain in Tibet, at an altitude of about 4,800 meters. Sasa was wearing my sunglasses.Sometimes, Sasa would be freezing when the weather was bad. We would rest for about half an hour if it was rainy.Sasa gave us more fun Like us, Sasa saw a lot of beautiful scenery and traveled around Tibet. She always seemed sensible and intelligent.p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Finally, our traveling team arrived at the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. This place is very well known in China, like the Statue of Liberty in the USA. The building in the background is the most well known building in Tibet; it's called the Potala Palace.Eventually, I had to leave, but I couldn't take a pet on the train or plane in China. Luckily, a temple of Lamaism promised that they would adopt Sasa.We just gave her a bath and cleaned her up. During that time, I felt like I was a failure!I have only been living in New York City for 1 year. Before I had to leave China and come to the United States, I took an airplane to Lhasa to see Sasa one more time. I feel like she's part of my family, and I miss her so much when I write this. Nevertheless, I'm glad to say that she's still healthy and happy. href="http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths/Kindness">Kindness
