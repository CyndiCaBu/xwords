No glove, no love.
I don&#8217;t remember what caught my eye first. It might have been the basket of free condoms with the NYC logo, or it could have been the message: No glove, no love.
I must admit that this isn&#8217;t the type of glove I think of when it&#8217;s cold outside. Most gloves don&#8217;t come in wrappers and they should have 5 fingers, shouldn&#8217;t they? Hmm.
Maybe the term doesn&#8217;t matter. The real point is protection. People may joke about it or say they don&#8217;t like it, but if this can help prevent transmission of HIV, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s worth it?
The picture was taken at a bookstore in lower Manhattan. It&#8217;s called Housing Works and the people who work there are volunteers, sharing a mission: ending HIV/AIDS and homelessness. Activists and others have worked on this goal since at least 1990. A lot of progress has been made, but more can be done.
What are you doing to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and ways people can stay safe?
