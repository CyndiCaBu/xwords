{Maya[s] still (couldn't)[x] believe[v] she('d)[x] actually broken[dtn] a small piece of bone in her toe}[t-p]. {She[s]('d)[x] been[dtn] playing[ger] soccer}[t-p], {her favorite sport}[extra]. {By accident}[f-r], {she[s] kicked[vxd] the goal post instead of the ball}[t-p]. {She[s] immediately fell[vxd] to the ground in real pain}[t-p] - {not faking[ger] it like so many professional soccer players do[x]}[extra]. Luckily[l], {she[s] was[x] able (to get)[inf] up and walk}[t-p], but[j] {(her foot)[s] really hurt[vxd]}[t-p]. {(Her mistake)[s] was[x] waiting[vg] a week (to see)[inf] a doctor}[t-p], {walking[ger] around and working[ger] as usual}[extra]. 

{Since the pain (didn't)[x] go away}[f-r], {Maya[s] finally went[vxd] to the doctor for an exam}[t-p]. {After checking[ger] some x-rays}[f-t], {(her doctor)[s] recommended[vxd] surgery (to fix)[inf] the broken bone}[t-p]. {Maya[s] (didn't)[x] exactly like[v] going[ger] to a hospital or surgical center}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] (didn't)[x] want[v] (to have)[inf] trouble walking[ger] later in life either}[t-p]. {She[s] decided[vxd] (to follow)[inf] the doctor's advice}[t-p].

{About a week before the surgery}[f-t], {Maya[s] had[vxd] some blood work done}[t-p]. {(Her doctor)[s] gave[vxd] her a prescription for an antibiotic}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] was[x] reluctant (to take)[inf] it}[t] {because she had[x] read a lot about antibiotic resistance}[e-r]. {She[s] knew[vxd] people who used antibiotics completely wrong}[t-p]. {They[s] would[x] take[v] some but[j] not finish[v] them}[t=p], {saving[ger] the rest (to share)[inf] with friends or family}[extra].

{Maya[s] (couldn't)[x] understand[v] why those people were[x] so foolish}[t-p]. {She[s] knew[vxd] antibiotics are[x] only useful for bacterial infections}[t-p], {not viruses}[extra]. {How could[x] anyone[s] know[v] what kind of infection their friends or family had[x]}[t-n]? {What kind of lab did[x] they[s] use[v] (to check)[inf]}[t-p] {if they (didn't)[x] check with a doctor}[e-cd]? {She[s] looked[vxd] at the presecription and hesitated[vxd]}[t=p]. 

{She[s] was[x] thinking[vg] about superbugs}[t-p] - {infections that are[x] hard (0to treat0)[inf] because the usual antibiotics (1don't1)[x] work anymore}[extra]. {She[s] had[vxd] a broken bone}[t-p], {not a bacterial infection}[extra]. {Why would[x] she[s] need[v] antibiotics?}[t-p] {She[s] mentioned[vxd] her concerns to her mother}[t-p], {a nurse}[extra]. {She[s] explained[vxd] that she (wasn't)[x] sure she really wanted (to fill)[inf] the prescription and start taking[ger] the antibiotics}[t-p]. {She[s] got[vxd] an earful in response}[t-p]. 

"{You[s] really (don't)[x] want[v] a bone infection}[t-n-nq], {do[x] you[s]}[t-n-nq]?" {her mother said}[extra]. "{Look[vxo] up osteomyelitis}[t-n-nq]. {If you (don't)[x] prevent it}[f-cd], {the next thing you[s] know}[extra], {you[s]('ll)[x] have[v] a big, gaping[ger] wound}[t-n]. {We[s]('ll)[x] have[v] (to start)[inf] catching[ger] flies (to treat)[inf] you with maggots}[t]!"

{Maya[s] laughed[vxd]}[t-p](;)[j] {she[s] was[x] used to her mother's sarcasm}[t-p]. {(An image of little white worms crawling[ger] on her toes)[s] came[vxd] to mind}[t-p].

"{You[s] think[vxo] I('m)[x] kidding[vg] about the maggots}[t-n], {(don't)[x] you[s]}[t-n-nq]?" {her mother replied}[extra]. "{When I[s] was[x] in nurses' training[ger] in the 1960s}[f-t], {we[s] had[vxs] a patient with a really bad case of osteomyelitis}[t-p]. {They[s] finally put[v] maggots in the wound (to eat)[inf] up all the dead tissue}[t-p]. {It[s] may[x] sound[v] disgusting}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] worked[vxd]}[t-p]. {(The patient)[s] recovered[vxd]}[t-p]."

{Maya[s] listened[vxd]}[t-p], {considering[ger] her options}[extra]. {(Her mother)[s] offered[vxd] more information}[t-p]. "{(Bone infections)[s] can[x] be[v] really nasty}[t-n]," {she explained}[extra]. "{They[s] (don't)[x] always heal[v] in a month or two}[t-n]. {You[s] could[x] be[v] on antibiotics for up to a year}[t-n]. {You[s] (don't)[x] want[v] the bone breaking[ger] down}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] certainly (don't)[x] want[v] your foot amputated}[t-n]! {Think[vxo] about it}[t=n-nq]. {(The long- term consequences)[s] are[x] not so pleasant}[t-n]."

{It[s] was[x] clear that her mother had[x] a point.}[t] {Maya[s] (didn't)[x] mind[v]}[t-p] {if she used sarcasm and humor (to get)[inf] her message across}[e-cd]. {(Her mother)[s] reassured[vxd] Maya that the antibiotic her doctor had[x] ordered probably (wouldn't)[x] cause any trouble}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] a drug with a long history}[t-p], and[j] {there[s] (weren't)[x] many pills in the prescription}[t-p]. {It[s] (wouldn't)[x] lead[v] to antibiotic resistance}[t-p]. {(Taking[ger] it)[s] would[x] be[v] much safer than risking[ger] a bone infection}[t-p], {her mother insisted}[extra]. 

{Maya[s] knew[vxd] she was[x] right}[t-p]. {She[s] decided[vxd] (to take)[inf] the antibiotics as ordered and (to introduce)[inf] her mom to those friends who played games with their own antibiotics}[t-p]. Superbug, anyone?
