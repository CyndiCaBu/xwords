{I[s] (don’t)[x] know[v] how many times I(’ve)[x] heard someone say that Haiti (doesn’t)[x] have any trees}[t-n], but[j] {that[s](’s)[x] clearly not true}[t-n]. (Yes,)[l] {Haiti[s] has[x] suffered[dtn] from years of deforestation}[t-b](;)[j] {trees[s] were[x] cut down for firewood and (to make)[inf] room for farms, houses, etc.}[t-p] However[l], {as you can[x] see from the photo here}[f-r], {Haiti[s] still has[vxs] trees}[t-n]. {It[s] would[x] be[v] much more helpful (to focus)[inf] on reforestation than deforestation}[t-n].

{There[s] are[x] many people working on this process (to make)[inf] Haiti greener again}[t-n], {including people in non-governmental organizations}[extra]. {NGOs  are[x] often criticized[dtn] for offering Haiti only short term solutions and doing the work that the government should[x] really do}[t-n]. {(Any tree-planting project that is locally supported and carefully planned)[s] should[x] be[v] welcome for its long-term benefits}[t-n] - {even if it does[x] come from an NGO}[extra].

{(One NGO that has[x] worked in Haiti since 2006)[s] is[x] called[dtn] SOIL}[t-n]. {(The name)[s] is[x] an acronym for Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods}[t-n]. {(The work they do)[s] is[x] both fascinating and useful}[t-n]. {In one project}[f-p], {SOIL[s] joined[vxd] another group called Trees Water People (to plant)[inf] 10,000 trees in Haiti}[t-p]. {They[s] used[vxd] their special form of compost (to nourish)[inf] those trees}[t-p]. {Since local Haitian people are[x] involved at every level}[f-r], {(the project)[s] should[x] have[v] a high chance of success}[t-n]. Hopefully[l], {it[s] will[x] inspire[v] more and more people (to plant)[inf] trees and take care of them as a national treasure}[t-n], {valuable to all}[extra]. 

{Reforestation[s] should[x] be[v] a national and global goal}[t-n] - {for everyone everywhere, for all the reasons you can[x] think of}[extra]!
