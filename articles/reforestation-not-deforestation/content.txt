{I[s] (don’t)[x] know[v] how many times I(’ve)[x] heard someone say that Haiti (doesn’t)[x] have any trees}[t-n], but[j] {that[s](’s)[x] clearly not true}[t-n]. (Yes,)[l] {Haiti[s] has[x] suffered[dtn] from years of deforestation}[t-b](;)[j] {trees[s] were[x] cut down for firewood and (to make)[inf] room for farms, houses, etc.}[t-p] However[l], {as you can[x] see from the photo here}[f-r], {Haiti[s] still has[vxs] trees}[t-n]. {It[s] would[x] be[v] much more helpful (to focus)[inf] on reforestation than deforestation}[t-n].

{There[s] are[x] many people working[ger] on this process (to make)[inf] Haiti greener again}[t-n], {including people in non-governmental organizations}[extra]. {NGOs  are[x] often criticized[dtn] for offering[ger] Haiti only short term solutions and doing[ger] the work that the government should[x] really do}[t-n]. {(Any tree-planting project that is locally supported and carefully planned)[s] should[x] be[v] welcome for its long-term benefits}[t-n] - {even if it does[x] come from an NGO}[extra].

{(One NGO that has[x] worked in Haiti since 2006)[s] is[x] called[dtn] SOIL}[t-n]. {(The name)[s] is[x] an acronym for Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods}[t-n]. {(The work they do)[s] is[x] both fascinating and useful}[t-n]. {In one project}[f-p], {SOIL[s] joined[vxd] another group called Trees Water People (to plant)[inf] 10,000 trees in Haiti}[t-p]. {They[s] used[vxd] SOIL's special form of compost (to nourish)[inf] those trees}[t-p]. {Since local Haitian people are[x] involved at every level}[f-r], {(the project)[s] should[x] have[v] a high chance of success}[t-n]. Hopefully[l], {it[s] will[x] inspire[v] more and more people (to plant)[inf] trees and take care of them as a national treasure}[t-n], {valuable to all}[extra]. 

{Reforestation[s] is[x] an important tool in slowing[ger] down climate change}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] measure[v] the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere}[t-n], and[j] {we[s] can[x] measure[v] global temperatures}[t-n]. {Both have risen significantly}[t-b] {since the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s}[e-t]. {(The carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere)[s] reached[vxd] 410 parts per million}[t-p], {up from 280ppm}[extra]. {How much carbon dioxide could[x] tree[s] take[v] from the atmosphere}[t-n-nq]? {Could[x] (enough trees all over the world)[s] keep[v] glaciers from melting}[t-n-nq]?

{Without reforestation all over the planet}[f-r], {(the average global temperature)[s] will[x] keep[v] rising[ger]}[t-n]. {(Islands like Haiti)[s] may[x] flood[v] or even disappear[v] under water}[t-n]. {According to Pieter Hoff of Groasis}[l], {"(the tree)[s] is[x] the cheapest instrument that humanity has[x] (to be)[inf] able (to bring)[inf] down the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the level of 280ppm"}[t-n-nq] - {the level it was at before 1790 or so}[extra]. {Reforestation[s], (planting millions more trees and taking care of them)[extra], might[x] be[v] our most effective solution}[t-n]. {When and where can[x] you[s] plant[v] trees}[t-n-nq]?
