 I don’t know how many times I’ve heard someone tell me that Haiti doesn’t have any trees, but that’s clearly not true. Yes, Haiti has suffered from years of deforestation, when trees were cut down to make room for farms, houses, etc. However, as you can see from the photo here, taken from the Hotel Montana in 2011, it would be much more helpful to focus on reforestation than deforestation.
 There are many people who are working on this process to make Haiti greener again, one tree at a time. Although NGOs (non-governmental organizations) are often criticized for offering Haiti only short term solutions and doing the work that the government should really do, no one can deny the benefits of a tree-planting project, whatever its source may be.
 One NGO that has worked in Haiti since 2006 is called SOIL. The name is an acronym for Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods, and the work they do is both fascinating and useful. In one current project, SOIL joined another group called Trees Water People to plant 10,000 trees in Haiti. They are using their unique form of compost to nourish these trees. Since local Haitian people are involved at every level, the project should have a high chance of success. Hopefully, it will inspire more and more people to plant trees and take care of them, as a national treasure, valuable to all.
