{I[s] (don’t)[x] know[v] how many times I[s](’ve)[x] heard someone tell me that Haiti (doesn’t)[x] have[v] any trees,}[t] but[j] {that[s](’s)[x] clearly not true.}[t] (Yes,)[l] {Haiti[s] has[x] suffered[dtn] from years of deforestation;}[t] {trees[s] were[x] cut down (to make)[inf] room for farms, houses, etc.}[t] However[l], {as you can[x] see from the photo here,}[f-r] {it[s] still has[vxs] trees.}[t] {It[s] would[x] be[v] much more helpful (to focus)[inf] on reforestation than deforestation.}[t]

{There[s] are[x] many people working on this process (to make)[inf] Haiti greener again,}[t] {including people in non-governmental organizations.}[extra] {NGOs  are[x] often criticized[dtn] for offering Haiti only short term solutions and doing the work that the government should[x] really do.}[t] (However,)[l] {(no one)[s] can[x] deny[v] the benefits of a tree-planting project,}[t] (whatever its source may[x] be.)[extra]

{(One NGO that has[x] worked in Haiti since 2006)[s] is[x] called[dtn] SOIL.}[t] {(The name)[s] is[x] an acronym for Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods,}[t] and[j] {(the work they do)[s] is[x] both fascinating and useful.}[t] {In one project,}[f-p] {SOIL[s] joined[vxd] another group called Trees Water People (to plant)[inf] 10,000 trees in Haiti.}[t] {They[s] used[vxd] their special form of compost (to nourish)[inf] those trees.}[t] {Since local Haitian people are[x] involved at every level,}[f-r] {(the project)[s] should[x] have[v] a high chance of success.}[t] (Hopefully,)[l] {it[s] will[x] inspire[v] more and more people (to plant)[inf] trees and take care of them,}[t] (as a national treasure, valuable to all.)[extra]
