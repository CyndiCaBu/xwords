{(The word “smog”)[s] refers[vxs] to the type of air pollution that you can[x] often see in the sky over cities.}[t-n-nq] (As a word,)[extra] {smog[s] has[vxs]  an interesting origin.}[t-n] {It[s] comes[vxs] from 2 words that were[x] combined (to make)[inf] one:}[t-n] {smoke plus fog equals smog.}[extra]
