The word “smog” refers to the type of air pollution that you can often see in the sky over cities. As a word, smog has  an interesting origin. It comes from 2 words that were combined to make one: smoke + fog = smog. 
There's a myth that smog has a positive side. We all know that it is absolutely not healthy; our cities would be much better places to live if we didn’t have so much air pollution. Yet some people claim that we can thank smog for making urban sunsets more colorful. However, if you check the science, you’ll find that is just not true. 
The color we normally see in the sky is a shade of blue, sometimes lighter and sometimes deeper or darker. That’s because the sunlight is made of a spectrum of colors. Imagine a rainbow, which goes from red and orange at one end to blue and violet at the other. Air molecules scatter the light, which means they separate it and make it go in different directions. Maybe this doesn’t make sense to you at the moment, but you can see how this happens if you look at the sky and see how its color looks different as time passes, from early in the morning to later in the evening. Then think about what time it is in other parts of the world. At the same exact moment on a summer day, the sky that looks light blue in Beijing, China at 8:00 in the morning might look like this pink sunset in Queens, New York at 8:00 in the evening. 
So what does  all this have to do with smog? The smog particles usually  are not all a similar size, so they don’t do a good job of scattering light. The truth is that they often make the sky look hazy, or just a dull gray. Smog can even block the sun, making the city look dirty. The places that are known for truly colorful sunsets are actually the tropics, deserts and open rural areas, where air pollution hasn’t contaminated the skies as much. What do  you think?
