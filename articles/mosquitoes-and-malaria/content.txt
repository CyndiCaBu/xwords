{Growing up in the northeastern part of the United States}[f-p], {I[s] never knew[vxd] much about malaria}[t-p]. {To me}[f-r], {mosquitoes[s] were[x] something to avoid}[t-p], but[j] {(getting bitten)[s] (didn’t)[x]  mean[v] getting sick}[t-p]. {It[s] just meant[vxd] that I would[x] have an itchy bump on my skin for a few days until it got better}[t-p].

{As an adult}[f-t], {I[s] learned[vxd] much more about malaria and the way human behavior can[x] make it easier or harder (to prevent)[inf] and treat diseases}[t-p]. {(A friend)[s] told[vxd] me how she had[x] worked as a doctor on a tuberculosis treatment program in her native country}[t-p], Somalia[extra]. {(Many of her patients there)[s] had[x] tested[dtn] positive for TB}[t-p]. {Although they were[x] given[dtn] medicine}[f-ct], {they[s] (didn’t)[x] take[v] it for all the time that they needed to}[t-p]. {As a result}[l], {they[s] could[x] not only get[v] sick with TB again later but also pass[x] it along to others}[t-n]. {Even worse}[l], {(the TB bacteria)[s] stayed[vxd] in their bodies and learned[vxd] how (to fight)[inf] the medicine}[t=p], {making it stronger and more dangerous}[extra].

{(Blaming those people)[s] (doesn't)[x] help[v]}[t-n]. {Because many of them (didn’t)[x] get a good education when they were[x] younger}[f-r], {they (didn’t)[x] understand[v] the way the disease and the medicine worked}[t-p-nq]. {They[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] that it takes time (to kill)[inf] the TB bacteria}[t-p-nq]. {They[s] thought[vxd] that they (could)[x] stop[v] taking the medicine}[t-p] {once they felt better}[e-t]. {Many[s] also thought[vxd] that their illness was[x] caused by something like witchcraft or a curse from someone who wanted (to harm)[inf] them}[t-p]. {Why did[x] they[x] know[x] more about superstition than science}[t-p-nq]? {(My friend and I)[s] shook[vxd] our heads sadly}[t-p], {too far away (to help)[inf]}[extra]. 

{A few years after learning about TB and other tropical diseases from my friend}[f-t], {I[s] went[vxd] to a place where those diseases were a serious problem}[t-p]. {(Some friends)[s] were[x] working[v] in Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to visit)[inf] them there}[t-p]. {I[s] (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to get)[inf] sick from malaria}[t-p], so[j] {I[s] took[vxd] medicine (to prevent)[inf] it}[t-p]. {Since I had[vxd] all the privileges of an outsider}[f-r], {I[s] was[x] given[dtn] a mosquito net (to sleep)[inf] under at night}[t-p]. {I[s] used[vxd] mosquito repellent and wore[vxd] long sleeves and long pants}[t=p] {whenever I could[x]}[e-t]. {I[s] also tried[vxd] (to avoid)[inf] being outside in the times of day when mosquitoes are[x] most active}[t-p]. 

{I[s] had[vxd] the knowledge and the resources (to try)[inf] (to prevent)[inf] malaria}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] (didn't)[x] stay[v] in a malaria zone long}[t-p]. {I[s] also knew[vxd] that I[s] could[x] find treatment}[t-p] {if I[s] did[x] get sick}[e-cd]. {That[s] should[x] not be[v] a privilege}[t-n] {in the 21st century}[e-t]. {When I[s] heard[vxd] that some of the local people had[x] gotten malaria}[f-t], {I[s] asked[vxd] about medicine}[t-p]. {Most[s] were[x] able (to find)[inf] it}[t-p], but[j] {they[s] (didn’t)[x] always take[v] it[s] as long as they were[x]  supposed to}[t-p]. {They[s] were[x] making[v] the same mistake as those people my friend tried (to treat)[inf] for TB}[t-p] {years before}[e-t] {on the other side of Africa}[e-p].

{I[s] felt[vxd] disappointed and disgusted}[t-p], {cursing their government}[extra]. {Why had[x] their schools and culture failed[dtn] (to teach)[inf] people them the basics}[t-p-nq]? {They[s] could[x] (read, write and do math)[v]}[t-p], and[j] {they[s] worked[vxd] really hard}[t-p]. {They[s] had[vxd] a right to understand the link between taking medicine correctly and preventing malaria}[t-p] {so that they could[x] stay healthy and keep going}[extra].

{After returning to the United States}[f-t], {I[s] was[x]  surprised[dtn] (to learn)[inf] that malaria had[x] once been a problem in northern areas}[t-p], too[extra]. {(The first time I heard about it in New York)[s] was[x] at the American Museum of Natural History}[t-p]. {There[s](’s)[x]  a model of a huge mosquito in one section}[t-n], {with information about how malaria once affected the city}[extra]. {By making an effort (to prevent)[inf] it}[f-r], {(New York)[s] succeeded[vxd] in eradicating the disease}[t-p]. {(The problem)[s] is[x]  complicated and enormous,}[t] but[j] {why (can't)[x] (other areas)[s] do[x] likewise?}[t]
 
{(The reality)[s] is[x]  that malaria (doesn’t)[x]  cost much (to prevent)[inf] or treat}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] can[x]  take[v] a country years and years before they manage (to get)[inf] rid of it}[t-n]. {Even today}[f-t], {when billions of dollars are[x] spent (to fight)[inf] malaria}[f-t], {it[s] is[x] part of far too many deaths}[t-n]. {This[s] has[vxs] real economic consequences}[t-n]. {(People who are[x]  too sick)[s] (can't)[x]  work[v]}[t-n], so[j] {they[s] lose[vxo] money}[t-n]. {(People who (0can’t0)[x] afford medicine and (1can't1)[x] get access to free medicine)[s] (don’t)[x]  have[v] an effective way (to find)[inf] treatment}[t-n]. {(Drug resistance)[s] has[x]  become[v] a major problem}[t-n], too[extra].

{Are[x] you doing[v] anything (to educate)[inf] people about health}[t-n]? {What kind of solutions}[s] can[x] you[s] think[v] of}[t-n] {(to reduce)[inf] ignorance, suspicion and diseases like malaria}[e-r]?
