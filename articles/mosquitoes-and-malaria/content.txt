(Growing up in the northeastern part of the U.S.,)[f] {I[s] never knew[vxd] much about malaria.}[t] (To me,)[l] {mosquitoes[s] were[x] something to avoid,}[t] but[j] {(getting bitten)[s] (didn’t)[x]  mean[v] getting sick.}[t] {It[s] just meant[vxd] that I would[x] have an itchy bump on my skin for a few days until it[s] got better.}[t]

(As an adult,)[l] {I[s] learned[vxd] much more about malaria and the way human behavior can[x]  make it easier or harder (to prevent)[inf] and treat diseases.}[t] {(A friend)[s] told[vxd] me about how she had[x] worked as a doctor on a tuberculosis treatment program in her native country,}[t] (Somalia.)[extra] {She[s] explained[vxd] that many patients who had[x] tested positive for TB (didn’t)[x] take their medicine for all the time that they needed to.}[t] {Because many people (didn’t)[x] get a good education when they  were[x] younger,}[f] {they (didn’t)[x] understand[v] the way the disease and the medicine worked.}[t] {They[s] thought[vxd] that they (didn’t)[x] need to continue taking the medicine}[t] (if they felt better.)[e] {Many[s] also thought[vxd] that their illness was[x]  caused by something like witchcraft or a curse from someone who wanted to harm them.}[t] Obviously[l], {the truth is[x] much different.}[t]

(A few years after I[s] had[x]  heard[dtn] about TB and other tropical diseases from my friend,)[f] {I[s] went to a place where those diseases were a serious problem.}[t] {(Some friends)[s] were[x] working[v] in Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia,}[t] and[j] {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to visit)[inf] them there.}[t] {I[s] (didn’t)[x] want to get sick from malaria,}[t] so[j] {I[s] took[vxd] medicine to prevent it}[t]. (Since I[s] had[vxd]  all the privileges of an outsider,)[f] {I[s] was[x] given[dtn] a mosquito net (to sleep)[inf] under at night,}[t] and[j] {I[s] used[vxd] mosquito repellent.}[t] {I[s] also wore[vxd] long sleeves and long pants whenever I[s] could[x]  and tried[vxd] (to avoid)[inf] the times of day when mosquitoes are[x] most active.}[t] 

{I[s] had[vxd] the knowledge and the resources  (to try)[inf] (to prevent)[inf] malaria.}[t] I[s] also knew[vxd] that I[s] could[x] find treatment}[t] (if I[s] did[x] get sick.)[e] {That[s] should[x] not be[v] a privilege}[t] (in the 21st century.)[e] (When I[s] heard[vxd] that some of the local people had[x] gotten malaria,)[f] {I[s] asked[vxd] about medicine.}[t] {Most[s] were[x] able (to find)[inf] it[s],}[t] but[j] {they[s] (didn’t)[x] always take[v] it[s] as long as they were[x]  supposed to.}[t] {I[s] felt disappointed and disgusted,}[t] {thinking that the local schools and culture had[x]  failed[dtn]  (to teach)[inf] people the link between taking medicine correctly and preventing malaria.}[extra]

(When I went back to the U.S.,)[f] {I[s] was[x]  surprised[dtn] (to learn)[inf] that malaria had[x]  been[dtn] a problem in northern areas in the past.}[t] {(The first time I heard about it in New York)[s] was[x] at the American Museum of Natural History.}[t] {There[s](’s)[x]  a model of a huge mosquito in one section,}[t] (with information about how malaria once affected the city.)[extra) (By making an effort  to prevent it,)[f] {(New York)[s] succeeded[vxd] in eradicating the disease.}[t] {(The problem)[s] is[x]  complicated and enormous,}[t] but[j] {why (can't[x]  (other areas)[s] do[x] likewise?}[t]
 
{(The reality)[s] is[x]  that malaria (doesn’t)[x]  cost much (to prevent)[inf] or treat,}[t] but[j] {it[s] can[x]  take[v] a country years and years before they manage to get rid of it.}[t] {Even today, when billions of dollars are[x] spent (to fight)[inf] malaria,}[f] {it[s] is[x]  blamed[dtn] for far too many deaths.}[t] {This[s] has[x]  real economic consequences.}[t] {(People who are[x]  too sick)[s] (can't)[x]  work[v],}[t] so[j] {they[s] lose[vxo] money.}[t] {(People who (can’t)[x] afford medicine and (can't)[x] get access to free medicine)[s] (don’t)[x]  have[v] an effective way (to find)[inf] treatment.}[t] {(Drug resistance)[s] has[x]  become[v] a major problem,}[t] (too.)[extra] {What kind of solutions}[s] can[x] you[s] think[v] of?}[t]
