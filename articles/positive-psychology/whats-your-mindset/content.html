<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">A mindset <span class="is_class">is</span> a way of thinking, especially a way that<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a habit. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a mentality, such as being open-minded or narrow-minded.
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Thinking about mindset in terms of education <span class="can_class">can</span> make a difference in how well we learn. For instance, <span class="do_class">do</span> you have certain ideas about your own abilities? <span class="have_class">Have</span> you ever said you<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> good at one subject but not another? Some people say they<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> good at math but not at languages, or vice versa. Yet <span class="are_class">are</span> they right? What makes them better at math than at language learning? <span class="is_class">Is</span> it a question of intelligence, or perhaps talent? What<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> the difference between talent and intelligence anyway?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">According to Carol Dweck, a researcher who studies motivation, successful learners see intelligence as potential. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> something that they <span class="can_class">can</span> develop. In her book <em>Mindset</em>, she describes different ways people respond to difficulties when learning.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Some people <span class="are_class">are</span> used to doing well in school, but when they suddenly find a subject difficult, they almost give up. That <span class="could_class">could</span> be due to a fixed mindset, a belief that they<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> just not good at that subject. Because of that belief, they <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> try as hard as they <span class="should_class">should</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Other people respond to a challenge by struggling. They make an extra effort to deal with the hard subject by studying more, getting help from others, or doing whatever they <span class="have_class">have</span> to do in order to learn. Instead of thinking it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> not for them, they work hard to make it for them by trying to learn. That<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a growth mindset, believing that you <span class="can_class">can</span> learn and get better at something. Instead of wasting time doubting themselves, people with a growth mindset put in the time and effort to make progress.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">A growth mindset comes naturally to us when we<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> children. We <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> even realize it at the time, but we spend our early years facing and overcoming all kinds of obstacles. Our whole job <span class="is_class">is</span> to learn and grow, and if we<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> lucky, we enjoy a lot of love and fun in the process. Going down a slide <span class="might_class">might</span> be scary at the top and briefly painful if you bump the ground too hard at the bottom, but we <span class="do_class">do</span> it anyway because it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> fun. That teaches us that we <span class="can_class">can</span> do it, which makes us try again. The more we remember our past success to get over our present fear, the more we <span class="can_class">can</span> learn and grow.<span </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Two simple words <span class="can_class">can</span> help us develop a growth mindset. Instead of telling ourselves that we <span class="cant_class">can&#8217;t</span> do something, it helps to say &#8220;Not yet.&#8221; Maybe you <span class="cant_class">can&#8217;t</span> do it yet, but if you try, you <span class="will_class">will</span> do it later. If you really want to, you <span class="can_class">can</span> learn how to do it well, whatever it <span class="is_class">is</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="can_class">can</span> learn more about growth and fixed mindset by looking for Carol Dweck on YouTube and other platforms, including her books.</p>
