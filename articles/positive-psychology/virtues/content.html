<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">All over the world, people <span class="have_class">have</span> specific ideas about what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> right and what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> wrong. This <span class="is_class">is</span> a sense of morals, beliefs about what we <span class="should_class">should</span> and <span class="shouldnt_class">shouldn&#8217;t</span> do. It includes ideas about moral excellence, things we <span class="should_class">should</span> strive for. Examples of moral excellence <span class="are_class">are</span> called virtues.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">In almost every culture and tradition, there <span class="are_class">are</span> certain virtues that people value. These virtues help us live good lives, full of meaning. They<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> essential for thriving. In positive psychology, cultures with a written history showing their religions and traditions <span class="were_class">were</span> studied to find virtues that <span class="have_class">have</span> had an important influence for thousands of years. This means texts <span class="were_class">were</span> analyzed from &#8220;Confucianism and Taoism in China, Buddhism and Hinduism in South Asia, and ancient Greece, Judeo-Christianity and Islam in the West,&#8221; according to the 2004 book <em>Character Strengths and Virtues</em>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This book describes one of the main concepts in positive psychology: the idea that we <span class="can_class">can</span> live good lives by figuring out our own character strengths and building on them. Our strengths <span class="are_class">are</span> related to the 6 universal virtues listed below.</p>
