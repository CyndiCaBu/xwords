<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Think about a time when you told someone some good news, talked about a positive experience, or described something that made you feel successful. It <span class="could_class">could</span> be something simple, like watching a movie you really enjoyed, or finding out that you <span class="could_class">could</span> leave work early. It <span class="could_class">could</span> also be something more meaningful, like doing well on a quiz or spending a day doing what you love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">How <span class="did_class">did</span> the other person react when you told them? <span class="did_class">Did</span> they seem interested? <span class="did_class">Did</span> they ask you questions to help you re-live the experience? If so, you probably felt better after the conversation. On the other hand, if the person <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> support you, or changed the topic or even said negative things, you probably felt worse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Research shows that we usually respond in 1 of 4 different styles, listed below. Imagine riding a unicycle over the Brooklyn Bridge, like the people in the photo. Later, you told a friend about your amazing day doing something difficult but really fun. Your friend <span class="could_class">could</span> say anything in response. Whatever he or she says, it <span class="would_class">would</span> probably show one of these response styles. Which one <span class="would_class">would</span> make you feel the best?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><strong>An active, constructive response</strong>: Wow, that sounds like fun! Tell me more. Where <span class="did_class">did</span> you go? What <span class="was_class">was</span> your favorite part?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><strong>An active, destructive response</strong>: Oh, no, a unicycle? That sounds really dangerous! You <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> even have anywhere to put your hands on a unicycle!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><strong>A passive, constructive response</strong>: Hmm, that<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> nice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><strong>A passive, destructive response</strong>: Yeah, I <span class="had_class">had</span> a good day too. I went to the park and played soccer with my friends. Afterwards we went out for some food; it <span class="was_class">was</span> great!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="might_class">might</span> wonder why the last response <span class="is_class">is</span> considered destructive. It <span class="may_class">may</span> seem positive, since the person talks about a good day and pleasant activities. However, those comments take the focus off the unicycle day completely. They ignore what the unicycle rider experienced, changing the topic. Even though that<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> not obviously negative, like the person who talked about the dangers of riding a unicycle, it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> still not supportive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Of these 4 response styles, there<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> only one that <span class="can_class">can</span> really help make relationships stronger: active, constructive response. We <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> always notice how we respond, but we <span class="can_class">can</span> try. Sometimes we <span class="might_class">might</span> not be in the mood to ask questions or really support someone else. We <span class="may_class">may</span> not have time to talk much, or we <span class="could_class">could</span> be distracted. Yet it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> worth making an effort to be aware of how we respond, and to try to respond in an active, constructive way. What we say <span class="can_class">can</span> make a difference in how others feel. That in turn <span class="can_class">can</span> affect our relationships with them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">We all <span class="have_class">have</span> choices to make. Why <span class="would_class">would</span> anyone choose more frustration and stress when we <span class="could_class">could</span> choose something more positive instead?</p>
