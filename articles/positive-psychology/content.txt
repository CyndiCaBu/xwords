Don&#8217;t let the title fool you. Positive psychology is not the same as positive thinking. It doesn&#8217;t deny reality. It doesn&#8217;t pretend that you can get whatever you want if you just think positive thoughts. What will change if you don&#8217;t make a plan and take real steps to reach your goals?
Positive psychology is a science, which means that it involves hard work and systematic study. It tries to define its terms. In other words, what does  the word &#8220;positive&#8221; mean? If you study positive psychology because you want to be happy, what does happiness mean? How can we measure it? If someone says that they are happy, how can we know if that&#8216;s true? If they are in fact happy, how happy are they? How do we know?
What about you? Are you happy? It might seem like a simple question, but it&#8216;s actually rather tricky. There are many types of happiness. Some are short-term and others last longer. When he taught an incredibly popular course in positive psychology at Harvard, Tal Ben-Shahar encouraged people to think about being happier now than before. Instead of asking if you&#8216;re happy, think about whether you&#8216;re happier now than you were at some previous time. Nowadays, Ben-Shahar focuses on helping people increase both their happiness and well-being.
If you&#8216;re asking what well-being is, good for you! Like any term, we have to define it. One of the psychologists who have contributed to the development of positive psychology is Martin Seligman. In his book Flourish, Seligman described a theory of well-being that has 5 elements. Each element can be measured, which is part of what makes positive psychology a science. Well-being theory goes by the acronym PERMA; each letter stands for one of the elements.
