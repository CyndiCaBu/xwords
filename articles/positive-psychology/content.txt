{(Don't)[x] let[v] the title fool you}[t-n-nq]. {(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] not the same as positive thinking}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] deny[v] reality}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] doesn't[x] pretend[v] that you can[x] get whatever you want just by thinking positive thoughts}[t-n-nq]. {What will[x] change[v]}[t-n-nq] {if you (don't)[x] make a plan and take real steps (to reach)[inf] your goals}[e-cd]? {Think[vxo] about that}[t-n-nq].

{(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] a science}[t-n]. {It[s] involves[vxs] hard work and systematic study}[t-n]. {It[s] tries[vxs] (to define)[inf] its terms}[t-n]. (For instance)[l], {what does[x]  (the word "positive")[s] mean[v]}[t-n-nq]? {If you study positive psychology because you want (to be)[inf] happy}[f-cd], {what does[x] happiness[s] mean}[t-n-nq]? {How can[x] we[s] measure[v] it}[t-n-nq]? {If someone says that they are[x] happy}[f-cd], {how can[x] we[s] know[v] if that('s)[x] true}[t-n-nq]? {If they are[x] in fact happy}[f-cd], {how happy are[x] they[s]}[t-n-nq]? {How do[x] we know[v]}[t-n-nq]?

{What about you[s]}[t-n-nq]? {Are[x] you[s] happy}[t-n-nq]? {It[s] might[x] seem[v] like a simple question}[t-n-nq], but[j] {it[s]('s)[x] actually rather tricky}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] many types of happiness}[t-n]. {Some[s] are[x] short-term}[t-n], and[j] {others[s] last[vxo] longer}[t-n]. 

{When he taught an incredibly popular course in positive psychology at Harvard}[f-t], {(Tal Ben-Shahar)[s] encouraged[vxd] people (to think)[inf] about being happier now than before}[t-p]. {Instead of asking if you('re)[x] happy}[f-ct], {think[vxo] about whether you('re)[x] happier now than you[s] were[x] at some previous time}[t-n-nq]. {Like other positive psychology practitioners}[extra], {(Ben-Shahar)[s] focuses[vxs] on helping people increase both their well-being and their happiness}[t-n].

{(Increasing our well-being)[s] is[s] the main goal or positive psychology}[t-n]. {(Definitions of well-being)[s] include[vxo] being healthy and comfortable as well as happy}[t-n]. {We[s] need[vxo] enough money to fulfill our basic needs and not worry about living from paycheck to paycheck}[t-n]. {We[s] do[x] not, however, need[v] a lot of money (to be)[inf] happy or (to flourish)[inf]}[t-n-nq].

{(Dr. Martin Seligman)[s], (a psychologist who has[x] made major contributions to the development of positive psychology)[extra], wrote[vxd] extensively about well-being}[t-p]. {In his book Flourish[title]}[f-p], {Seligman described a theory of well-being that has[x] 5 elements}[t-p]: {positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishment}[extra]. {(Each of these elements)[s] can[x] be[v] measured}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] part of what makes positive psychology a science}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] learn[v] more about it}[t-n] {on this site}[e-p] {in articles about (strengths, virtues, mindset, savoring)[em], and more}[extra].
