{(Don't)[x] let[v] the title fool you}[t-n-nq]. {(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] not about trying[ger] (to be)[inf] positive all the time}[t-n-nq]. {It[s]('s)[x] not the same as positive thinking}[t-n-nq]. {(Looking for what('s)[x] good)[s] can[x] help[v][t-n], but[j] {we[s] also need[v] (to face)[inf] reality}[t-n]. {(Not everything)[s] is[x] positive all the time}[t-n]. 

{(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] a science}[t-n]. {It[s] comes[vxs] from hard work studying how people thrive and what makes life worth living}[t-n]. {Like any science}[l], {(positive psychology)[s] tries[vxs] (to define)[inf] its terms}[t-n]. (For instance)[l], {what does[x]  (the word "positive")[s] mean[v]}[t-n-nq]? {How can[x] we[s] measure[v] positivity}[t-n-nq]? {How about happiness - what does[x] that[s] mean}[t-n-nq]? {How can[x] we[s] measure[v] it}[t-n-nq]? {Is[x] happiness[s] even the goal}[t-n-nq]? {(Positive psychology)[s] tries[v] (to answer)[inf] these questions and more}[t-n].

# Happiness

{(Research on happiness)[s] shows[v] that there[s] are[x] many types of it}[t-n]. {Some[s] are[x] short-term}[t-n], and[j] {others[s] last[vxo] longer}[t-n]. {We[s] (don't)[x] need[v] (to feel)[inf] happy all the time}[t-n];[j] {we[s] can[x] accept[v] ups and downs and still be[v] fine}t-n]. {(One positive psychology professor)[s], (Tal Ben-Shahar)[extra], encouraged[vxd] people (to think)[inf] about being[ger] happier now than before}[t-p]. {Happiness[s] is[x] only one part of positive psychology}[t-n]. {(The real goal)[s] is[x] well-being}[t-n].

# Well-Being

{(Definitions of well-being[ger])[s] include[vxo] being[ger] healthy and comfortable as well as happy}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] find[v] information about financial well-being too}[t-n]. {(Some research)[s] indicates[v] that we need enough money (to meet)[inf] our basic needs for food, shelter and safety}[t-n]. {(More money)[s] can[x] make[v] us more comfortable}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] (doesn't)[s] always increase[v] our well-being}[t-n].

{(Understanding well-being)[s] at a deeper level is[x] one way (to build)[inf] it}[t-n]. {(The psychologist Martin Seligman)[s] proposed[vxd] a theory about well-being}[t-p] {in his book Flourish[title]}[e-p]. {(His theory)[s] includes[s] the following 5 elements}[t-n].

 - Positive emotions
 - Engagement
 - Positive relationships
 - Meaning
 - Accomplishment

{(Each of these elements)[s] can[x] be[v] measured}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] part of what makes positive psychology a science}[t-n] - {asking for clear definitions and evidence}[extra]. {Besides Seligman}[l], {(other positive psychology researchers)[s] added[v] a 6th element}[t-p]: {health and vitality}[extra].

{(The acronym PERMAH)[s] can[x] help[v] you remember all 6 elements}[t-n]. 

 - P for positive emotions
 - E for engagement
 - R for relationships
 - M for meaning
 - A for accomplishment
 - H for health and vitality

{You[s] can[x] learn[v] more about PERMAH}[t-n] {in many articles on this website}[e-p], {including these}[extra]:
