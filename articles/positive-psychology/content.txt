{(Don't)[x] let[v] the title fool you}[t-n-nq]. {(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] not about trying[ger] (to be)[inf] positive all the time}[t-n-nq]. {It[s]('s)[x] not the same as positive thinking}[t-n-nq]. {It[s]('s)[x] not a cure for depression}[t-n] {although it can[x] be[v] one of many sources of help}[e-ct].

{(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] a science}[t-n] - {the science of well-being}[extra]. {Like any science}[l], {it[s] tries[vxs] (to define)[inf] its terms}[t-n]. (For instance)[l], {what does[x]  (the word "positive")[s] mean[v]}[t-n-nq]? {How can[x] we[s] measure[v] positivity}[t-n-nq]? {How about happiness - what does[x] that[s] mean[v]}[t-n-nq]? {How can[x] we[s] measure[v] it}[t-n-nq]? {Is[x] happiness[s] even the goal}[t-n-nq]? {What about well-being}[t-n-nq]? {(Positive psychology)[s] tries[v] (to answer)[inf] these questions and more}[t-n].

# Happiness

{(Research on happiness)[s] shows[v] that there[s] are[x] many types of it}[t-n]. {Some[s] are[x] short-term}[t-n], and[j] {others[s] last[vxo] longer}[t-n]. {We[s] (don't)[x] need[v] (to feel)[inf] happy all the time}[t-n]. {(One positive psychology professor)[s], (Tal Ben-Shahar)[extra], encouraged[vxd] people (to think)[inf] about being[ger] happier now than before}[t-p]. {We[s] can[x] also accept[v] that happiness comes and goes}[t-n]. {(The real goal)[s] is[x] well-being}[t-n].

# Well-Being

{(Definitions of well-being[ger])[s] include[vxo] being[ger] healthy and comfortable as well as happy}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] find[v] information about financial well-being too}[t-n]. {(Some research)[s] indicates[v] that we need enough money (to meet)[inf] our basic needs for food, shelter and safety}[t-n]. {(Living paycheck to paycheck)[s] is[x] hard}[t-n]. {(Worrying that someone will steal your money when you have more)[s] is[x] also hard}[t-n], {in a different way}[extra]. {Although having more money can[x] make[v] us more comfortable}[f-ct], {it[s] (doesn't)[s] always increase[v] our well-being}[t-n].

So[l] {what does[x]}[t-n-nq]? {(The psychologist Martin Seligman)[s] proposed[vxd] a theory about this}[t-p] {in his book Flourish[title]}[e-p]. {It[s] includes[s] the following 5 elements of well-being}[t-n].

 - Positive emotions
 - Engagement
 - Positive relationships
 - Meaning
 - Accomplishment

{(Each of these elements)[s] can[x] be[v] measured}[t-n]. {Like other fields in science}[l] {(positive psychology)[s] looks[v] for clear definitions and evidence}[extra]. {For example}[l], {(the term engagement)[s] has[x] a different meaning than the one you might[x] know}[t-n]. {It[s] involves[v] using your strengths (to live)[inf] a full life and paying attention to life as you live it}[t-n]. {It[s] includes[v] more complicated concepts like flow}[t-n] - {something that is easier (to feel)[inf] than (to explain)[inf]}[extra]. {Along with the other elements of positive psychology}[f-r], {engagement is part of what makes life worth living}[t-n].

{In addition to the 5 elements that Seligman proposed}[l], {(other positive psychology researchers)[s] added[v] a 6th one}[t-p]: {health and vitality}[extra]. {(The acronym PERMAH)[s] can[x] help[v] you remember all these elements of well-being}[t-n].
