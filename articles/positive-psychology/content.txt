{(Don't)[x] let[v] the title fool you}[t-n-nq]. {(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] not about trying[ger] (to be)[inf] positive all the time}[t-n-nq]. {It[s]('s)[x] not the same as positive thinking}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] deny[v] reality}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] doesn't[x] pretend[v] that you can[x] get whatever you want just by thinking[ger] positive thoughts}[t-n-nq]. {After all}[l], {what will[x] change[v]}[t-n-nq] {if you (don't)[x] make a plan and take real steps (to reach)[inf] your goals}[e-cd]?

{(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] a science}[t-n]. {It[s] involves[vxs] hard work and systematic study}[t-n]. {It[s] tries[vxs] (to define)[inf] its terms}[t-n].

# Happiness

{In terms of happiness}[l], {there[s] are[x] many types of it}[t-n]. {Some[s] are[x] short-term}[t-n], and[j] {others[s] last[vxo] longer}[t-n]. {When he taught an incredibly popular course in positive psychology at Harvard}[f-t], {(Tal Ben-Shahar)[s] encouraged[vxd] people (to think)[inf] about being[ger] happier now than before}[t-p]. {Instead of asking[ger] if you('re)[x] happy}[f-ct], {think[v] about whether you('re)[x] happier now than you[s] were[x] at some previous time}[t-n-nq]. {Like other positive psychology practitioners}[extra], {(Ben-Shahar)[s] focuses[vxs] on helping[ger] people increase both happiness and well-being[ger]}[t-n].

# Well-Being
