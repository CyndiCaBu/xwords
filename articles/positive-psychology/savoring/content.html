<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Savoring means more than just tasting or smelling something. In positive psychology, paying attention to our positive experiences, appreciating them and enhancing them <span class="is_class">is</span> all part of savoring. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a process of slowing down to notice what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> around us and how we feel, considering all 5 senses.
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">We <span class="can_class">can</span> savor positive experiences that happened in the past by remembering them and appreciating them again. We <span class="can_class">can</span> also savor the present moment, by taking the time to appreciate whatever <span class="is_class">is</span> positive in what we<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> experiencing right here, right now. Savoring the future <span class="can_class">can</span> happen when we look forward to an experience that we expect to be positive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">There <span class="are_class">are</span> at least 10 different strategies that <span class="can_class">can</span> help us savor what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> good in our daily lives. One <span class="is_class">is</span> sharing positive experiences with others. One person <span class="might_class">might</span> not notice something pleasant until someone else points it out. For instance, the first time Fernando Montoya got off the 7 train at the new 34th Street station, he <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> notice the ceiling right away. He <span class="was_class">was</span> just focused on getting out of the station and heading for the Highline. When his friend started commenting on how interesting the mosaic design <span class="was_class">was</span>, Fernando looked up and pretended to be shocked. His friend laughed and took his picture. By laughing together and sharing the expression of wonder and appreciation, both people felt positive emotions. This <span class="was_class">was</span> all part of savoring their experience.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Here <span class="are_class">are</span> some other ways to practice savoring:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Sharpen your senses (taste, touch, sight, sound, smell). Focus on certain stimuli and block out others.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Immerse yourself in the moment. Let yourself experience absorption.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Take clear mental photographs. What <span class="do_class">do</span> you need to notice now to help you remember this moment later? Think about how you <span class="would_class">would</span> share this experience with others. What <span class="would_class">would</span> you tell them?</p>
