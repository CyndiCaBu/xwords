{(A rainy day in New York)[s] is[x] like a rainy day anywhere}[t-n] - {wet}[extra]! {(The rainwater)[s] flows[vxs] along the sidewalks and streets and disappears[vxs] down the catch basins}[t-n], {those metal grates that often collect a lot of trash}[extra]. {(Keeping those grates free of cups, food wrappers and other trash)[s] is[x] one way (to keep)[inf] the water flowing into the sewer system}[t-n]. {What happens[vxs] to it there}[t-n-nq]?

{(The answer)[s] depends[vxs] on the neighborhood}[t-n]. {(Around 40 per cent of the city)[s] uses[vxs] a separate sewer system}[t-n], {where rainwater and sewage go in separate pipes}[extra]. {(More than half the city)[s] is[x] served[v] by a combined sewer system}[t-n], {which means that rainwater mixes with sewage in the same pipe}[extra]. {(The combined system)[s] works[vxs] fine}[t-n] {in dry weather}[e-t]. Unfortunately[l], {(rainy weather)[s] is[x] a different story}[t-n].

{In the combined system}[f-p], {rain[s] mixes[vxs] with pee, poop, toilet paper, cooking grease and other types of waste and flows[vxs] directly into our rivers and other bodies of water}[t-n]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] have[v] a chance (to go)[inf] through the usual treatment process}[t-n]. {In other words}[l], {we[s] treat[vxo] the rivers and the harbor as our toilets and sinks}[t-n].{You[s] can[x] see[v] this happen at any of the 700 overflow points in all 5 boroughs}[t-n] {if you look on a rainy day}[e-cd].

{So what can[x] we[s] do[v] about this disgusting overflow problem}[t-n-nq]? {(Part of the answer)[s] comes[vxs] from the city}[t-n], {in the form of inspection, maintenance and repairs}[extra]. {(Green infrastructure like rain gardens)[s] also makes[vxs] a difference}[t-n]. {(Every patch of green space with living[ger] plants and trees)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater and absorb it into the soil}[t-n], {reducing the pressure on the combined sewer system}[extra]. 

{(The rest of us)[s] can[x] change[v] our own behavior}[t-n] {during and after heavy rain}[e-t]. {(The easiest way)[s] is[x] simply (to avoid)[inf] activities that use water while it('s)[x] raining[v]}[t-n]. {This[s] includes[vxs] washing the dishes, doing laundry, mopping the floors, taking a shower, etc}[t-n]. {Waiting[s] might[x] not be[v] the most convenient option}[t-n-nq], but[j] {(untreated sewage in the river)[s] is[x] preventable}[t-n]. 

{In my case}[extra], {(learning about overflow)[s] made[vxd] me change my behavior}[t-p]. {I[s] used[vxd] (to love)[inf] being in the ocean while it was[x] raining[v]}[t-p-nq]. {I[s] used[vxd] (to wash)[inf] the dishes and do laundry whenever I needed to}[t-p], {regardless of the weather}[extra]. Now[l] {I[s] (don't)[x] even go[v] to the beach}[t-n-nq] {if it has[x] rained[v] recently}[e-cd] {because I[s] (don't)[x] want[v] (to swim)[inf] next to other people's poop}[e-r]. 

{So where does[x] rain[s] go[v]}[t-n-nq] {in NYC}[e-p]? {It[s] flows[vxs] into our gardens and our parks, our sidewalks and our streets, our rivers and our estuary, as well as New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] flow[v] there clean}[t-n], {after being processed by our wastewater treatment facilities}[e-t]. Or[l] {it[s] can[x] go[v] there dirty}[t-n] {due to overflow from the combined sewer system}[e-r]. {It[s]('s)[s] up to us (to remember)[inf] the overflow problem and do[x] what we can[v] (to help)[inf] prevent it}[t-n].
