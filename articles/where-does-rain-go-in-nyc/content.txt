{(A rainy day in New York)[s] is[x] like a rainy day anywhere}[t-n] - {wet}[extra]! {(The rainwater)[s] flows[vxs] along the sidewalks and streets and disappears[vxs] in rain gardens and catch basins}[t-n].  {It[s] gets[vxs] treated in the sewer system}[t-n], and[j] then[l] {it[s] flows[vxs] into our rivers and oceans}[t-n], {clean and clear}[extra].

{Is[x] that[s] really what happens to rainwater}[t-n-nq] {in NYC}[e-p]? {(The answer)[s] depends[vxs] on the neighborhood}[t-n]. {(Around 40 per cent of the city)[s] uses[vxs] a separate sewer system}[t-n], {where rainwater and sewage go in separate pipes}[extra]. {In those areas}[f-p], {(the answer)[s] is[x] yes}[t-n]. {Rainwater[s] does[x] get[v] dirty from motor oil and trash in the streets}[t-n], but[s] {it[s] gets[vxs] cleaned}[t-n] {before it flows into our waterways}[e-t].

However[l], {it[s]('s)[x] a different story in other neighborhoods}[t-n]. {(More than half the city)[s] is[x] served[v] by a combined sewer system}[t-n]. {(Rainwater there)[s] mixes[vxs] with sewage in the same pipes}[t-n]. {(This combined system)[s] works[vxs] fine}[t-n] {in dry weather}[e-t] {because all that dirty water has a chance to get treated}[e-r]. 

Unfortunately[l], {(the combined system)[s] does[x] not work[v] well}[t-n] {during rainy weather}[e-t]. {(Too much water)[s] flows into the system at the same time}[t-n]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] have[v] a chance (to go)[inf] through the usual treatment process}[t-n]. {As a result}[l], {rainwater[s] mixes[vxs] with pee, poop, toilet paper, cooking grease and other types of waste}[t-n]. Then[l] {(this dirty mix)[s] flows[vxs] directly into our rivers and the Atlantic Ocean}[t-n]. 

{This[s] is[x] called[v] overflow}[t-n], and[j] {it[s] happens[vxs]}[t-n] {in all 5 boroughs}[e-p]. {You[s] can[x] see[v] it for yourself}[t-n] {if you want}[e-cd]. {Just go[v] outside on a rainy day and visit[v] any of the 700 overflow points}[t-n-nq]. 

{Would[x] you[s] like[v] (to do)[inf] something (to solve)[inf] this disgusting overflow problem}[t-n-nq]? {(The easiest way)[s] is[x] simply (to avoid)[inf] activities that use water while it('s)[x] raining[v]}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] wash[v] the dishes, do[v] the laundry, mop[v] the floors or take[v]  a shower later}[t-n], {a couple hours after the rain}[extra]. Or[l] {you[s] can[x] plan[v] ahead}[t-n], {doing water-related tasks before the rain}[extra]. {These[s] might[x] not seem[v] like the most convenient options}[t-n-nq], but[j] {do[x] you[s] really want[v] poop, oil and other waste in our rivers}[t-n-nq]?

{(Other helpful actions)[s] include[v] planting a garden and volunteering (to keep)[inf] tree pits and rain gardens free of trash}[t-n].{(Every patch of green space with living plants and trees)[s] helps[vxs] catch the rainwater and absorb it into the soil}[t-n], {reducing the pressure on the combined sewer system}[extra] - {and the gross stuff in our waterways}[extra].
