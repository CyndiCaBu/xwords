{In New York City,}[f] {it[s](’s)[x] easy (to feel)[inf] far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas.}[t] {We[s] have[vxo] running water, toilets and toilet paper, and so much more.}[t] {(Most of us)[s] probably (don’t)[x] want[v] (to think)[inf] too much about where everything goes}[t] {when we flush the toilet.}[e] Ye[dtn]t[l] {(the reality)[s] is[x] that New York City is indeed a city of water.}[t] {We[s] are[x] surrounded by water everywhere,}[t] {from the rivers and canals to the Atlantic Ocean itself.}[e]

{In some neighborhoods,}[f] {when it[s] rains enough,}[f] {(the water that runs into the sewers)[s] goes[vxs] directly to those local waterways.}[t] {There[s](’s)[x] obviously[l] some pollution involved}[t] {since the water that runs off the street takes whatever motor oil and other harmful substances along with it.}[e] However[l], {in most neighborhoods,}[f] {(the rainwater and melted snow)[s] go[vxo] into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants}[t] {first.}[e]

{There[s] is[x] too much water in the sewage system all at one time}[t] {when it rains a lot or plenty of snow is[x] melting.}[e] {In that case,}[l] {(the mix of excess storm water and untreated sewage)[s] flows[vxs] directly into the city’s waterways.}[t] {You[s] might[x] want[v] (to think)[inf] about this}[t] {before eating any fish caught from NYC waters or going to the city beaches after a rainstorm.}[e]

{(Some people)[s] recommend[vxo] flushing the toilet less often}[t] {when it[s]’s raining,}[e] {just (to reduce)[inf] the amount of water in the NYC sewer system.}[extra] {(Other solutions)[s] include[vxo] rooftop farming,}[t] {like at Brooklyn Grange, Eagle Street Farms and other places.}[extra] {(These places)[s] absorb[vxo] the rainwater}[t] {before it even reaches the streets.}[e] {(Community gardens, parks and every patch of green space with living plants)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater,}[t] (too.)[extra]
