{In New York City}[f-p], {it[s](’s)[x] easy (to feel)[inf] far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas}[t-n]. {We[s] have[vxo] running water that we can[x] drink[v] without getting[ger] sick}[t-n]. {Since we have indoor plumbing}[f-r], {we[s] (don't)[x] need[v] a bucket (to take)[inf] a shower or bath}[t-n]. {(Our sinks and toilets)[s] make[vxo] our waste disappear}[t-n], but[j] {where does[x] it[s] go[v]}[t-n-nq]?

{In most New York neighborhoods}[f-p], {(rainwater, melted snow, and the water we use at home)[s] all go[vxo] into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants}[t-n] {first}[e-t]. {(This water)[s] gets[vxs] processed and tested (to make)[inf] sure it('s)[x] clean}[t-n] {before it gets back in our rivers, harbors, etc}[e-t]. 

{What[s] would[x] happen[v]}[t-n-nq] {if rainwater mixed with waste from the toilet and other places}[e-cd]? {Would[x] (all that water)[s] make[v] us sick}[t-n-nq] {when it reached the waterways}[e-t]? {What[s] would[s] happen[v] to the wildlife there}[t-n-nq], {including fish, turtles and birds}[extra]? 

{In some neighborhoods}[f-p], {(that kind of mixture)[s] happens[x]}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] called[dtn] combined sewer overflow}[t-n], {or just overflow for short}[extra]. {After a heavy rainfall}[f-t], {(the water that runs into the sewers)[s] goes[vxs] directly to our local waterways}[t-n]. {In other words}[l], {we[s] treat[vxo] the rivers and the harbor as our toilets and sinks}[t-n].

{(To see)[inf] that happen}[f-r], {you[s] can[x] go[v] to one of the overflow spots}[t-n] {during a big rainstorm}[e-t]. {One[s] empties[vxs] dirty water into Dutch Kills}[t-n] {right behind LaGuardia Community College}[e-p]. {Others[s] dump[vxo] untreated water into the East River, the Harlem River and the Hudson River}[t-n]. Yet[l] {(some people)[s] go[vxo] fishing[ger] in those waterways}[t-n]. {Do[s] they[s] know[v] about overflow}[t-n-nq]?

{Before I learned about this}[f-t], {I[s] used[vxd] (to love)[inf] swimming in the ocean while it was[x] raining[v]}[t-p-nq]. Now[l] {I[s] (don't)[x] even go[v] to the beach}[t-n-nq] {if it has[x] rained[v] recently}[e-cd]. {It[s] takes[vxs] time for the system (to absorb)[inf] the excess)[s] water}[t-n]. 

{(All of us)[s] can[x] help[v] reduce the overflow problem}[t-n]. {When it[s]('s)[x] raining[v] or it has[x] rained[v] recently}[f-t], {(laundry and the dishes)[s] can[x] wait[v]}[t-n] - {at least a few hours}[extra]. {If showers (can't)[x] wait[v]}[f-cd], {at least we[s] can[x] make[v] them shorter}[t-n-nq]. {We[s] can[x] flush[v] the toilet less often}[t-n], too[extra]. {When millions of people all follow this advice}[f-t], {we[x] can[x] make[v] a difference}[t-n]. {(All these simple actions)[s] will[x] combine[v] (to reduce)[inf] the amount of water in the NYC sewer system}[t-n], {and thus the amount that goes to overflow}[extra].

{What else can[x] we[s] do[v] (to help)[inf] take care of our water}[t-n-nq]? {If we have a house}[f-cd], {we[s] can[x] choose[v] more landscape and less hardscape}[t-n]. {(Every patch of green space with living[ger] plants)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater and put it to good use}[t-n]. {(People who replace their front or back yards with cement or stone)[s] (don't)[x] realize[v] that they are[x] inviting[v] the rain to flood their basements}[t-n-nq]. {(Plants, bushes and trees)[s] help[vxo] the soil absorb rainwater and melting snow}[t-n]. 

{(The city)[s] encourages[vxo] people (to take)[inf] care of plants and trees in public spaces along the sidewalk}[t-n]. {It[s] spent[vxd] millions of dollars on green infrastructure}[t-n] {especially rain gardens}[extra]. {(People who throw trash in them or complain about them)[s] just (don't)[x] understand[v] their value}[t-n-nq] - {or (don't)[x] recognize[v] their own tax dollars in those complicated little gardens}[extra]. {By helping keep raingardens clean}[f-r], {we[s] can[x] help[v] them catch rainwater}[t-n] {instead of trash}[e-t].

{So where does[x] rain[s] go[v]}[t-n-nq] {in NYC}[e-p]? To our gardens and our parks, to our sidewalks and our streets, to our rivers and our estuary, plus New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean. {It[s] can[x] go[v] there clean}[t-n], {after being processed by our wastewater treatment facilities}[e-t]. Or[l] {it[s] can[x] go[v] there dirty}[t-n] {due to overflow}[e-r]. {It[s]('s)[s] up to us (to be)[inf] selfish or (to collaborate)[inf] on improving the health of our local waterways}[t-n].
