{In New York City}[f-p], {it[s](’s)[x] easy (to feel)[inf] far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas}[t-n]. {We[s] have[vxo] running water, toilets and toilet paper, and so much more}[t-p]. {(Most of us)[s] probably (don’t)[x] want[v] (to think)[inf] too much about where everything goes}[t-p] {when we flush the toilet}[e]. Yet[l] {(the reality)[s] is[x] that New York City is indeed a city of water}[t-n]. {We[s] are[x] surrounded by water everywhere}[t-n], {from the rivers and canals to the Atlantic Ocean itself}[e-p].

{In some neighborhoods}[f-p], {when it[s] rains enough}[f-t], {(the water that runs into the sewers)[s] goes[vxs] directly to those local waterways}[t-n]. {There[s](’s)[x] obviously some pollution involved}[t-n] {since the water that runs off the street takes motor oil and other harmful substances along with it}[e-r]. However[l], {in most neighborhoods}[f-p], {(the rainwater and melted snow)[s] go[vxo] into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants}[t-n] {first}[e-t].

{There[s] is[x] too much water in the sewage system all at one time}[t-n] {when it rains a lot or plenty of snow is[x] melting}[e-t]. {In those cases}[l], {(the mix of excess storm water and untreated sewage)[s] flows[vxs] directly into the city’s waterways}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] want[v] (to think)[inf] about this}[t-n] {before eating any fish caught from NYC waters or going to the city beaches after a rainstorm}[e-t].

{(Some people)[s] recommend[vxo] flushing the toilet less often}[t-n] {when it[s]’s raining}[e-t] {just (to reduce)[inf] the amount of water in the NYC sewer system}[extra]. {(Doing laundry before heavy rain instead of during or after)[s] can[x] help[v]}[t-n]. {(Other solutions)[s] include[vxo] rooftop farming}[t-n], {like at Brooklyn Grange, Eagle Street Farms and other places}[extra]. {(Community gardens, parks and every patch of green space with living plants)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater}[t-n], (too)[extra]. {(These places)[s] absorb[vxo] the rainwater}[t-n] {before it even reaches the streets}[e-t]. 

{If you're curious about this topic}[f-r], {you[s] might[x] be[v] interested in studying a map of combined sewer overflow locations in NYC}[t-n]. {Try (to visit)[inf] one when it's raining a lot (to see)[inf] what comes out and where it goes}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] could[x] be[v] disgusting}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] will[x] make[v] you think}[t-n].
