{In New York City}[f-p], {it[s](’s)[x] easy (to feel)[inf] far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas}[t-n]. {We[s] have[vxo] running water that we can drink without getting sick, showers and sinks, toilets and toilet paper, and so much more}[t-p]. {(Most of us)[s] probably (don’t)[x] want[vxo] (to think)[inf] too much about where everything goes}[t-p] {when we flush the toilet}[e]. {However}[l], {when it's raining hard}[f-t], {that[s]('s)[x] exactly what we should[x] keep in mind}[t-n]. 

{In most New York neighborhoods}[f-p], {(rainwater, melted snow, and the water we use at home)[s] all go[vxo] into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants}[t-n] {first}[e-t]. {(This water)[s] goes[vxs] through a process  (to clean)[inf] it}[t-n] {before it gets back to our rivers, harbors, etc}[e-t]. {However}[l], {in some neighborhoods}[f-p], {(the situation)[s] is[x] different}[t-n]. {After a heavy rainfall}[f-t], {(the water that runs into the sewers)[s] goes[vxs] directly to our local waterways}[t-n] {like rivers and harbors}[extra]. {That[s] includes[vxs] water from our kitchens, bathrooms and more}[t-n]. 

{We[s] can[x] actually see[v] that dirty water going into the waterways}[t-n] {if we visit certain locations during a big rainstorm}[e-cd]. {Just look[v] for a map of combined sewer overflow (CSO) locations}[t-n-nq]. {There[s] are[x] some at Ward's Island that dump untreated water into the East River, the Harlem River and the Hudson River}[t-n]. {It[s] seems[vxs] disgusting}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] also be[v] harmful for fish, birds and other wildlife}[t-n].

{What does[x] it[s] mean[v] for us}[t-n-nq]? {(Going to the beach after a lot of rain)[s] would[x] not be[v] smart}[t-n]; {(some CSO's)[s] dump[vxo] untreated sewage into the Atlantic Ocean}[t-n]. {(Eating any fish caught from NYC waters)[s] would[x] be[v] riskier than usual}[t-n]. {In addition to avoiding contaminated water}[l], {we[s] can[x] take[v] specific steps (to help)[inf] solve this problem}[t-n].

{(The main step)[s] involves[vxs] paying attention to the water and waiting until the system has had a chance to absorb the excess}[t-n]. {Laundry[s] can[x] wait[v] and so can[x] the dishes}[t-n-nq] {- like it or not}[extra]. {(Taking shorter showers)[s] can[x] make[v] a real difference}[t-n], {especially when millions of people all follow this advice}[extra]. {(The same)[s] is[x] true for flushing the toilet less often}[t-n]. {When it[s]’s really wet outside}[f-t], {(all these simple actions)[s] combine (to reduce)[inf] the amount of water in the NYC sewer system}[extra]. 

{(The city)[s] has[vxs] a program (to encourage) New Yorkers (to do)[inf] this}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] sign[v] up (to receive)[inf] text messages that tell us about too much rain and let us know when it('s)[x] ok}[t-n]. {(The NYC Department of Environmental Protection)[s] has[vxs] more information about this}[t-n].

{(Other solutions)[s] involve[vxo] plants and trees}[t-n]. {(Covering a yard with plants and trees instead of concrete)[s] can benefit the air as well as the water system}[t-n]. {(Every rooftop farm and garden)[s] plays[vxs] a role in catching rainwater and snow}[t-n]. {(Community gardens, parks and every patch of green space with living plants)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater}[t-n], (too)[extra]. {(These places)[s] absorb[vxo] rainwater}[t-n] {before it even reaches the streets}[e-t].
