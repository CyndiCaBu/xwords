In New York City, it’s easy to feel far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas.  We have running water, toilets and toilet paper, and so much more. Most of us probably don’t want to think too much about where everything goes when we flush the toilet. Yet the reality is that in New York we are surrounded by water everywhere, from the rivers and canals to the Atlantic Ocean itself. 
In some neighborhoods, when it rains, the water that runs into the sewers goes directly to those local waterways. There’s obviously some pollution involved, since the water that runs off the street takes whatever motor oil and other harmful substances along with it. However, in most neighborhoods, the rainwater and melted snow go into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants first.
One problem is that when it rains a lot or a plenty of snow is melting, there is too much water in the sewage system at one time. In that case, the mix of excess storm water and untreated sewage flows directly into the city’s waterways. You might want to think about this before eating any fish caught from NYC waters or going to the city beaches after a rainstorm.
Some people recommend flushing the toilet less often when it’s raining, just to reduce the amount of water in the NYC sewer system. Other solutions include rooftop farming, like at Brooklyn Grange, Eagle Street Farms and other places. These places absorb the rainwater before it even reaches the streets. Community gardens, parks and every patch of green space with living plants can help catch the rainwater, too.
