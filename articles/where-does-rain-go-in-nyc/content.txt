{In New York City}[f-p], {it[s](’s)[x] easy (to feel)[inf] far from the types of sanitation problems that people struggle with in other areas}[t-n]. {We[s] have[vxo] running water that we can drink without getting sick}[t-n]. {We[s] (don't)[x] need[v] a bucket (to take)[inf] a shower or bath}[t-n]. {(Our sinks and toilets)[s] make[vxo] our waste disappear}[t-n], and {if they (don't)[x]}[f-cd], {we[s] fix[v] them}[t-n]. {(Most of us)[s] probably (don’t)[x] want[vxo] (to think)[inf] too much about where everything goes}[t-p] {when we flush the toilet}[e]. {However}[l], {when it's raining hard}[f-t], {that[s]('s)[x] exactly what we should[x] keep in mind}[t-n]. 

{In most New York neighborhoods}[f-p], {(rainwater, melted snow, and the water we use at home)[s] all go[vxo] into the sewer system and the city’s wastewater treatment plants}[t-n] {first}[e-t]. {(This water)[s] gets[vxs] processed and tested (to make)[inf] sure it('s)[x] clean}[t-n] {before it gets back in our rivers, harbors, etc}[e-t]. 

{What[s] would[x] happen}[t-n-nq] {if rainwater mixed with waste from the toilet and other places}[e-cd]? {Would[x] (all that water)[s] make[v] us sick}[t-n-nq] {when it reached the waterways}[e-t]? {What[s] would[s] happen[v] to the wildlife there}[t-n-nq], {including fish, turtles and birds}[extra]? 

{In some neighborhoods}[f-p], {(that kind of mixture)[s] happens[x]}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] called[dtn] combined sewer overflow}[t-n], {or CSO}[extra]. {After a heavy rainfall}[f-t], {(the water that runs into the sewers)[s] goes[vxs] directly to our local waterways}[t-n]. {It('s)[x] like using the river or the harbor as our toilet or sink}[t-n] - {in a city that some call the capital of the world}[extra].

{We[s] can[x] actually see[v] that dirty water going into the waterways}[t-n] {if we visit certain locations during a big rainstorm}[e-cd]. {(Maps showing the CSO spots)[s] are[x] available online}[t-n]. {Examples[s] include[vxo] CSO's at Ward's Island that dump untreated water into the East River, the Harlem River and the Hudson River}[t-n]. {Do[s] (the people who go fishing in some of these waterways)[s] know[v] that}[t-n-nq]?

{What does[x] (this CSO system)[s] mean[v] for us}[t-n-nq]? {(Understanding it)[s] can[x] help[v] us make decisions (to avoid)[inf] contaminated water}[t-n]. {We[s]('d)[x] know[x] (to stay)[inf] away from the beach}[t-n] {after a lot of rain}[e-t]. {We[s]('d)[x] consider[v] extra risks}[t-n] {before eating any fish caught from NYC waters}[e-t]. 

{We[s] can[x] also take[v] specific steps (to help)[inf] solve this problem}[t-n]. {(Paying attention to the rain and waiting until the system has[x] had a chance (0to absorb0)[inf] excess)[s] is[x] the main idea}[t-n]. {(Laundry and the dishes)[s] can[x] wait[v]}[t-n] - {like it or not}[extra]. {(Taking shorter showers)[s] can[x] make[v] a real difference}[t-n], {especially when millions of people all follow this advice}[extra]. {(The same)[s] is[x] true for flushing the toilet less often}[t-n]. {When it[s]’s really wet outside}[f-t], {(all these simple actions)[s] combine (to reduce)[inf] the amount of water in the NYC sewer system}[extra]. 

{(New Yorkers)[s] can[x] participate[v] in a program that encourages these actions}[t-n] {by texting us}[e-r] {whenever we should[x] use less water}[e-t]. {(The public service ads)[s] say[vxo] (Wait ... you can be a hero)[title]}[t-n]. {(The NYC Department of Environmental Protection website)[s] has[vxs] more information about this}[t-n].

{(The city)[s] also offers[vxs] grants}[t-n] {(to help)[inf] community groups take care of plants and trees in public spaces like along the sidewalk}[e-r]. {(Every patch of green space with living plants)[s] can[x] help[v] catch the rainwater and put it to good use}[t-n]. {(Millions of dollars)[s] were[x] spent[dtn] on green infrastructure}[t-n] {(to reduce)[inf] waste going through CSO's and into our waterways}[e-r]. {This[s] includes[vxs] small rain gardens called bioswales}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] help[v] them catch rainwater}[t-n] {instead of trash}[e-t].

{Where does[x] rain[s] go[v]}[t-n-nq] {in NYC}[e-p]? {Maybe[l] we[s] should[x] ask[v] why waste still goes with it and do[v] what we can[v] (to fix)[inf] this}[t-n-nq].
