 While we were  walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park on a beautiful weekend in 2012, we noticed a few couples posing for wedding photos. We stopped to look at them for a minute, and it quickly became clear that we didn’t share the same interest. One of us was busy watching the couples laugh and smile for the cameras, while the other was  focused on the car that was waiting nearby. We thought it was either a Bentley or a Rolls Royce, but we really didn’t know for sure. Other people who were walking by stopped to admire it, too. Even in a city with quite a few millionaires, we don’t  see a classic luxury car like this very often.
The funny part was when the bride and groom tried to get in the car. Holding a bouquet of flowers and trying to fit layers of fabric in at the same time didn’t look easy. The bride was probably trying not to get the dress dirty or wrinkled, but the skirt kept popping out of the open door. The groom was trying to help, although there really wasn’t  much he could do. Anyway, that gave everyone another chance to appreciate the car. A few minutes later they drove away, hopefully to a happy life together.
