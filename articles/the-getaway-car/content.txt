{While walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park on a beautiful summer weekend}[f-t], {we[s] noticed[vxd] a few couples posing for wedding photos}[t-p]. {We[s] stopped[vxd] (to look)[inf] at them and take some pictures}[t-p]. {It[s] quickly became[vxd] clear that we (weren’t)[x] looking at exactly the same things}[t-p]. {(One of us)[s] was[x] watching[v] the couples laugh and smile for the cameras}[t-p]. {(The other)[s] was[x]  focused[dtn] on a car waiting nearby}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] either a Bentley or a Rolls Royce}[t-p](;)[j]  {we[s] really (didn’t)[x] know[v] for sure}[t-p]. {(Other people walking by)[s] stopped[vxd] (to admire)[inf] it}[t-p] (too)[extra]. {Even in a city with quite a few millionaires}[f-ct], {we[s] (don’t)[x] see[v] a classic luxury car like that very often}[t-n].

{(The funny part)[s] was[x] when the bride and groom tried (to get)[inf] in the car}[t-p]. {(The bride)[s] was[x] holding a bouquet of flowers and trying (to fit)[inf] layers of fabric from her wedding gown into the car as she sat down}[t-p], but[j] {(the skirt)[s] kept[vxd] popping out of the open car door}[t-p]. {(The groom)[s] was[x] trying[v] (to help)[inf]}[t] {although there really wasn’t  much he could[x] do}[e-ct]. {It[s] looked[vxd] like the fabric was[s] fighting him}[t-p]. 

{(At least)[l] (0the couple0)[s] was[x] laughing[v]}[t-p], {a good sign}[extra]. {A few minutes later}[f-t], {they[s] drove[vxd] away}[t-p], {hopefully to a happy life together focusing on each other's strengths}[extra] - {love, humor and more}[extra].
