{(The name Piaget)[s] means[vxs] different things to different people.}[t] {It[s] brings[vxs] memories of teaching and learning to anyone who has[x] studied developmental psychology or theories of learning.}[t] (On the other hand,)[l] {(a person who loves a certain type of fine jewelry)[s] might[x] associate[v] the name Piaget with a shop like the one in the photo.}[t]

{(Jean Piaget) was[x] an educator and lifelong learner from Switzerland who inspired many others (to think)[inf] deeply about how people think and learn.}[t] (When he was[x] young,)[f] {Piaget[s] studied[vxd] natural sciences,}[t] but[j] {he[s] is[x] known[dtn] for his work in education.}[t] (Instead of thinking of children as miniature adults,)[l], {Piaget[s] suggested[vxd] that their brains work in a different way.}[t] {(A younger child)[s] has[vxs] a less logical way of thinking than an older one.}[t] {That[s](’s)[x] why you[s] can[x] take[v] a small child on a 30-minute trip, (one that you[s]’ve taken together before,)[extra] and hear the same questions every 5 minutes:}[t] {Are[x] we there yet? When are[x] we going (to get)[inf] there? How much longer? Etc.}[extra]

Sometimes[l] {we[s] might[x] think[v] a child is[x] being unreasonable or difficult,}[t] but[j] {(the reality)[s] is[x] that the brain develops and changes over time.}[t] (Even as adults,)[f] {(our knowledge)[s] grows[vxs]}[t], and {(our perspective)[s] changes[vxs].}[t] {How  does[x] this[s] happen[v]?}[t] (If logic builds over time,)[f] {can[x] we keep[v] working on this}[t] (as we get older?)[e] {How does[x] language[s] affect[v] the way we think?}[t] (Today,)[l] {(the Jean Piaget Society)[s] continues[vxs] (to explore)[inf] questions like these.}[t]

{You[s] can[x] learn[v] about Piaget and developmental psychology for free}[t] (online or in a library.)[e] (Likewise,)[l] (if the name Piaget brings images of fine jewelry to mind,)[f] {you[s] can[x] also learn about it[s]}[t]. {(Another Piaget) was[x] born[dtn]}[t] (in Switzerland about 20 years before Piaget the educator.)[f] {(That Piaget)[s] began[vxd] making watches}[t] (in a workshop on his family's farm)[e]. (Over the years,)[f] {(his business)[s] expanded[vxd]}[t], and[j] {(diamonds and fine metals)[s] became[vxd] part of the process.}[t] 

(Today,)[l] {(the name Piaget)[s] represents a luxurious brand of jewelry.}[t] {(A necklace like the one in the photo)[s] probably costs[vxs] as much as or more than a decent car.}[t] {If you(’re)[x] ever on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan or another place with a Piaget shop,}[f] {you[s] can[x] take[v] a look.}[t]

{Everyone[s] has[x] their own ideas of what’s beautiful, interesting, and right.}[t] (Considering that,)[l] {would[x] you[s] rather learn[v] more about Jean Piaget's ideas of how people learn or Piaget the jeweler's[x] business of how (to sell)[inf] luxury?}[t]
