{(The name Piaget)[s] means[vxs] different things to different people}[t-n]. {It[s] brings[vxs] memories of teaching[ger] and learning[ger]}[t-n] {to anyone who has[x] studied developmental psychology or theories of learning[ger]}[e-r]. (On the other hand)[l], {(a person who loves a certain type of fine jewelry)[s] might[x] associate[v] the name Piaget with a shop like the one in the photo}[t-n].

{(Jean Piaget)[s] was[x] an educator and lifelong learner from Switzerland}[t-p]. {Through his work and his books}[f-r], {he[s] inspired[vxd] many others (to think)[inf] deeply about how people think and learn}[t-p]. {When he was[x] young}[f-t], {Piaget[s] studied[vxd] natural sciences}[t]. {He[s] is[x] known[dtn], (however)[l], for his work in education}[t-n]. 

(Instead of thinking[ger] of children as miniature adults)[l], {Piaget[s] suggested[vxd] that their brains work in a different way}[t-p]. {(A younger child)[s] has[vxs] a less logical way of thinking[ger] than an older one}[t-n]. {That[s](’s)[x] why you can[x] take a small child on a 30-minute trip, (one that you[s]’ve taken together before)[extra], and still hear the same questions every 5 minutes}[t-n]: {Are[x] we there yet? When are[x] we going[vg] (to get)[inf] there? How much longer?}[extra]

Sometimes[l] {we[s] might[x] think[v] a child is[x] being[vg] unreasonable or difficult}[t-n] {when actually they just (can't) understand what we can[x] yet}[e-t]. {(The reality)[s] is[x] that their brains develop and change over time}[t-n] {as they grow}[e-t]. {Even as adults}[f-t], {(our knowledge)[s] grows[vxs]}[t-n], and {(our perspective)[s] changes[vxs]}[t-n].

{How  does[x] this[s] happen[v]}[t-n-nq]? {If logic builds over time}[f-cd], {can[x] we keep[v] working[ger] on this}[t-n-nq] {as we get older)[e-t]? {How does[x] language[s] affect[v] the way we think}[t-n-nq]? Today[l], {(the Jean Piaget Society)[s] continues[vxs] (to explore)[inf] questions like these}[t-n].

{You[s] can[x] learn[v] about Piaget and developmental psychology for free}[t-n] {online or in a library}[e-p]. Likewise[l], {if the name Piaget brings images of fine jewelry to mind}[f-cd], {you[s] can[x] also learn[v] about that}[t-n]. {(Another Piaget)[s] was[x] born[dtn]}[t-p] {in Switzerland}[e-p] {about 20 years before Piaget the educator}[e-t]. {(That Piaget)[s] began[vxd] making[ger] watches}[t-p] {in a workshop on his family's farm}[e-p]. {Over the years}[f-t], {(his business)[s] expanded[vxd]}[t-p]. {(Precious stones and fine metals)[s] became[vxd] part of the process}[t-p]. 

Today[f-t] {(the name Piaget)[s] represents a luxurious brand of jewelry}[t-n]. {(A necklace like the one in the photo)[s] probably costs[vxs] as much as or more than a decent car}[t-n]. {If you(’re)[x] ever on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan or another place with a Piaget shop}[f-cd], {you[s] can[x] take[v] a look for yourself}[t-n].

{Everyone[s] has[vxs] their own ideas of what’s beautiful, interesting, and right}[t-n]. (Considering that)[l], {would[x] you[s] rather learn[v] more about Jean Piaget's ideas of how people learn or Piaget the jeweler's business of how (to sell)[inf] luxury}[t-n-nq]?
