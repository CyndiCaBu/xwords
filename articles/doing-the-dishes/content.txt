{Elisabeth[s] does[vxs] the dishes by hand}[t-n] {even though she has[vxs] a dishwasher right next to the sink}[e-ct]. {She[s] (doesnâ€™t)[x] use[v] it very often}[t-n] {because she prefers (to wash)[inf] the dishes herself}[e-r]. {She[s] likes[vxs] the feel of warm water on her hands}[t-n]. 

{Instead of spending[ger] time drying[ger] the dishes with a towel}[f-ct], {she[s] lets[vxs] them air dry}[t-n]. {She[s] says[vxs] that drying[ger] them is a waste of time and energy}[t-n], but[j] {(making them all fit in the dish drainer)[s] is[x] like doing[ger] a puzzle}[t-n]. {It[s] makes[vxs] her brain work in a logical way}[t-n]. {It[s] also avoids[vxs] the risk of unhealthy microbes passing[ger] from a dish towel to the dishes}[t-n].
