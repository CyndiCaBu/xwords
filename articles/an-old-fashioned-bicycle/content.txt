 Hmmm&#8230; have  you ever ridden an old-fashioned bicycle? It looks pretty in the image that was etched in this glass window, but it doesnâ€™t look comfortable. Looking at it brings several questions to mind. Why is the front wheel so much bigger than rear? Back when these bikes were popular, did women ride them? If so, how did they do it? And did they wear pants or long dresses? In socio-economic terms, were these bikes used by people of all social classes, from the richest of the rich to the poorest of the poor? In practical terms, do you think they were  used for delivery, the way modern bikes are used in New York today? If so, that could lead to more questions.
 This photo was taken outside a restaurant in the East Village of Manhattan, probably on 12th Street. That restaurant probably has a delivery service, doesn&#8217;t it? If it does , what kind of bike do  the delivery people ride? If you were  one of them, would you like it to be a bike like this? You would need to have good balance and you could not be afraid of heights. With a little practice, you might have fun delivering food in the 21st century like someone who was born more than a hundred years before you.
