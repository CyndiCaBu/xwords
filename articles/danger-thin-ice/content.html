The warning on the sign here is very clear in English and Spanish. There’s even a symbol for anyone who doesn’t understand those languages or who learns more clearly through images. Even though the ice looks solid, there’s a risk of falling through it because it’s thin. It looks a little like someone already tried to walk over the pond, but they didn’t get very far. On the other hand, the marks on the ice might be footprints, but not necessarily from a person. They could be from an animal or maybe from chunks of ice and snow falling from the trees above.
On a cold, snowy day, it can be hard to remember how different a frozen pond looks in warmer months, when the water is in liquid form. This is actually one of the basic scientific concepts we all learn. Matter exists in 3 forms: solid, liquid and gas. When water freezes and turns to ice, it’s a solid. If that ice melts, it’s a liquid again. To change it to a gas, you have to boil it enough to produce steam. It’s water the whole time, just in different forms. This process is called a change of state and it’s usually caused by a temperature change.
So, what do you think? Would you rather see a pond in its solid form or its liquid form? How about both?
