{(One thing that does[x] not change about New York City)[s] is[x] the fact that it[s]('s)[x] always changing[v]}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] especially true in terms of construction}[t-n]. {(Old buildings)[s] are[x] demolished[v]}[t], and[j] {(new ones)[s] are[x] built[v]}[t-n].

(In some cases)[l], {(the old and the new)[s] are[x] joined[v] in a unique way}[t-n]. {Here}[f-p] {it[s] looks[v] like someone stuck a new metal structure on top of an old brick building}[t-n]. {It[s] would[x] be[v] easy (to laugh)[inf] or scoff at the way the metal seems (to be)[inf] rusting[ger]}[t-n], but[j] {that[s] was[x] done[v] on purpose}[t-n]. {There[s]('s)[x] another building in Long Island City with a similar color and texture}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] covered[v] with a metal known as CorTen steel}[t-n], {which was[x] designed[v] (to rust)[inf] in a beautiful or at least interesting way}[extra]. {(One advantage)[s] is[x] that you would[x] never need[v] (to paint)[inf] the building}[t-n]. {You[s] could[x] simply appreciate[v] its lovely rusted surface}[t-n]. {(A disadvantage)[s] is[x] that the sidewalk or any other area under the CorTen steel can[x] stain[v]}[t-n].

{(The steel structure pictured here)[s] is[x] in DUMBO}[t-n], {a neighborhood in Brooklyn near the Manhattan Bridge}[extra].  {(The difference between the metal structure and the brick building)[s] intrigued[v] me}[t-p]. {I[s] wondered[v] when the metal part was[x] built[v] and why}[t-p]. {Could[x] it[s] be[v] a stairwell}[t-n-nq]? {Is[x] it[s] fully enclosed[v]}[t-n], or[j] {does[x] it[s] have[v] some openings for air (to flow)[inf] through}[t-n]? {If so}[f-cd], {what[s] happens[v]}[t-n-nq] {when it rains}[e-t]?

{I[s] would[x] like[v] (to visit)[inf] that unusual structure on a beautiful day}[t-n], {(to spend)[inf] some time safely hanging[ger] out in the clouds}[extra]. {(A friend of mine)[s] would[x] probably suffer[v] from vertigo there and complain[v] about the rust}[t=n], but[j] {I[s]('d)[x] enjoy[v] it}[t-n]. {Who do[x] you[s] identify[v] with more}[t-n-nq] - {me or my friend}[extra]?
