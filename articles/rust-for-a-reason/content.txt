{(One thing that does not[x] change about New York City)[s] is[x] the fact that it('s)[x] always changing}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] especially true in terms of construction}[t-n]. {(Old buildings)[s] are[x] demolished[dtn]}[t], and[j] {(new ones)[s] are[x] built[dtn]}[t-n].

(In some cases)[l], {(the old and the new)[s] are[x] joined[dtn] in a unique way}[t-n]. {Here}[f-p] {it[s] looks[vxs] like someone stuck a new metal structure on top of an old brick building}[t-n]. {It[s] would[x] be[v] easy (to laugh)[inf] or scoff at the way the metal seems (to be)[inf] rusting}[t-n], but[j] {that[s] was[x] done[dtn] on purpose}[t-n]. {There[s]('s)[x] another building in Long Island City with a similar color and texture}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] covered[dtn] with a metal known as Cor-Ten steel}[t-n], which was[x] designed (to rust)[inf] in a beautiful or at least interesting way}[t-n]. {(One advantage)[s] is[x] that you would[x] never need (to paint)[inf] the building}[t-n]. {You[s] could[x] simply appreciate[v] its lovely rusted surface}[t-n]. {(A disadvantage)[s] is[x] that the area under the Cor-Ten steel, (such as the sidewalk)[extra], can[x] stain}[t-n].

{(The steel structure pictured here)[s] is[x] in DUMBO}[t-n], {a neighborhood in Brooklyn near the Manhattan Bridge.}[extra]  {When I took the picture}[f-t], {I[s] was[x] fascinated[dtn] by the way the structure looks like it('s)[x] hanging in the sky}[t-n]. {I[s] wondered[vxd] when it was[x] built and why}[t-p]. {Could[x] it[s] be[v] a stairwell}[t-n-nq]? {Is[x] it[s] fully enclosed}[t-n], or[j] {does[x] it[s] have[v] some openings for air (to flow)[inf] through}[t-n]? {If so}[f-cd], {what[s] happens[vxs]}[t-n-nq] {when it rains}[e-t]?

{I[s] would[x] like[v] (to visit)[inf] that unusual structure on a beautiful day}[t-n], {(to spend)[inf] some time safely hanging out in the clouds}[extra]. {(A friend of mine)[s] would[x] probably suffer[v] from vertigo there and complain[v] about how the rust looks}[t=n], but[j] {I[s]('d)[x] enjoy[v] it}[t-n]. {Who do[x] you[s] identify[v] with more}[t-n-nq] - {me or my friend}[extra]?
