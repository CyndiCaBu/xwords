One thing that doesn't change about New York City is the fact that it's always changing. That's especially true in terms of construction. Old buildings are demolished and new ones are built. In some cases, the old and the new are joined in a unique way. In the case of the building pictured here, it looks like someone has stuck a new metal structure on the top of an old brick building. It would be easy to laugh or scoff at the way the metal looks like it's rusting, but that was done on purpose. There's another building in Long Island City with a similar color and texture. It was covered with a metal known as Cor-Ten steel, which was designed to rust in a beautiful or at least interesting way. The idea is that you would never need to paint a building if you could simply appreciate its lovely rusted surface.
The steel structure pictured here is in DUMBO, a neighborhood in Brooklyn near the Manhattan Bridge.  When I took the picture, I was fascinated by the way it looks like it's hanging in the sky. I wondered when it was built and why. Could it be a stairwell? Is it fully enclosed, or does it really have some openings for air to flow through? If so, what happens when it rains? Finally, I would like to know if I could visit that funny structure on a beautiful day, to spend some time safely hanging out in the clouds. A friend of mine would probably suffer from vertigo there, but I think I'd enjoy it. Who do you identify with more, me or my friend?
