{Tigers[s] are[x] often called[dtn] big cats,}[t] {for obvious reasons.}[e] {With the shape of their bodies and the way they move,}[extra] {they[s] look[vxo] very similar to the types of cats humans have[x] lived with for thousands of years.}[t] {We[s] know[vxo] that tigers and pet cats are[x] all carnivores;}[t] {they can[x] eat[v] many kinds of living creatures.}[t] {Unlike tigers in the wild,}[l] {(pet cats)[s] (don’t)[x] need[v] (to catch)[inf] their own food (to survive)[inf].}[t] {They[s] can[x] live[v] happily on the dried or canned food that we humans feed them.}[t]

{We[s] usually think[v] of tigers as the real killers}[t] {since they have[vxo] (to kill)[inf] if they (don’t)[x] want (to starve)[inf] to death.}[e] However[l], {(a study of house cats who go outside)[s] showed[vxd] that pet cats (haven’t)[x] lost[dtn] their killer instincts at all.}[t]
