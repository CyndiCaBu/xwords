{Tigers[s] are[x] often called[dtn] big cats}[t-n] {for obvious reasons}[e-r]. {They[s] look[vxo] and move[vxo] like the smaller cats humans have[x] lived with for thousands of years}[t=n]. {(Both types of cats)[s] are[x] carnivores}[t-n](;)[j] {they can[x] eat[v] many kinds of living creatures}[t-n]. 

{We[s] tend[vxo] (to think)[inf] of the big cats as the real killers}[t-n]. {They[s] have[vxo] two choices}[t-n] {in the wild}[e-p]: {kill (to eat)[inf] or starve to death}[extra]. {(Pet cats)[s], (on the other hand)[extra], (don’t)[x] need[v] (to catch)[inf] their own food (to survive)[inf]}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] live[v] happily on the dried or canned food that we humans feed them}[t-n]. However[l], {they[s] still have[vxo] killer instincts}[t-n].

{(As many as 12.3 billion mammals)[s] die[v]}[t-n] {each year}[e-t] {in the teeth and claws of house cats that go outside}[e-p], {according to a study}[extra]. {This[s] includes[vxs] mice and rats}[t-n], {animals we expect cats (to eat)[inf]}[extra], {as well as squirrels, rabbits and other mammals}[extra]. {Birds[s] have[vxo] an advantage over cats}[t-n]: {they can[x] fly away}[extra]. {Despite that}[f-ct], {(pet cats)[s] kill[vxo] about 2.4 billion birds}[t-n] {per year}[e-t] - {a significant amount}[extra]. 

{(The study)[s] claims[vxs] that it (doesn’t)[x] matter if cats are[x] fed by humans or not}[t-n]. {(Their instinct)[s] tells[vxs] them (to hunt)[inf]}[t-n], and[j] {if they get the opportunity}[f-cd], {they[s](’ll)[x] follow[v] that instinct}[t-n].

{(Reading about this study)[s] reminded[vxd] me of something I saw in my neighborhood a few years ago}[t-p]. {It[s] shocked me at the time}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] made[vxd] sense}[t-p]. {As I was[x] walking near an overgrown garden}[f-t], {I[s] saw[vxd] something moving in the tall grass}[t-p]. {At first}[f-t] {I[s] thought[vxd] it was[x] just a cat}[t-p]. Then[l] {I[s] realized[vxd] that the cat (wasn’t)[x] alone}[t-p]. {It[s] had[vxd] another animal in its mouth}[t-p]. {I[s] assumed[vxd] it was[x] a rat}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] (didn’t)[x] really want[v] (to see)[inf] it}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] looked[vxd] anyway}[t-p]. {I[s] was[x] surprised[dtn] (to see)[inf] the cat eating a squirrel}[t-p]. {Until then}[f-t], {I[s] thought cats limited themselves to birds, mice and rats}[t-p]. {(Squirrels)[s] seem[vxo] big compared to the size of cats}[t-n], but[j] {omnivores[s] eat[vxo] what they can[x] find}[t-n].

{I[s] (couldn't)[x] tell[v]}[t-n] {whether that cat was[x] a stray or a pet}[e-cd]. {(Even a pet cat that got outside)[s] would[x] eat[v] a squirrel, bird or other animal}[t-n]. {(Cats' hunting instinct)[s] (doesn’t)[x] disappear[v]}[t-n] {when we keep them inside as protected pets}[e-t]. {We[s] might[x] think[v] it(’s)[x] good for them (to get)[inf] outside and have[x] some fun acting like wild little tigers}[t-n]. Nonetheless[l], {(the study)[s] found[vxd] that cats risk their health outside with our chemical wastes, traffic, etc.}[t-p] 

{If you have a cat and you (don’t)[x] want it (to get)[inf] hurt or sick}[f-cd], {you[s] should[x] probably keep[v] it indoors}[t-n]. {(Your cat)[s] will[x] find[v] a spider or something else inside (to satisfy)[inf] its hunting instincts}[t-n] {anyway}[extra]. {That[s] can[x] be[v] a reason (to feel)[inf] grateful to your little carnivore}[t-n]!
