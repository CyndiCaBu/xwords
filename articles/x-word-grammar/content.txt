{English[s] has[x] 20 short words with a lot of power}[t-n]. {You[s] might[x] know[v] some of them as helping verbs and others as modal auxiliary verbs}[t-n]. {In x-word grammar}[f-p], {(these 20 words)[s] are[x] called[v] x-words}[t-n].

{We[s] use[vxo] x-words to}[t-n]:

 - ask questions
 - give short answers
 - make negative statements
 - find subjects and verbs
 - show time: now? before? both?

# Use X-Word Grammar

{(X-word grammar)[s] is[x] different from traditional grammar}[t-n]. {It[s] takes[v] time (to learn)[inf]}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] need[v] an open mind (to get)[inf] used to the different terms for grammar you might[x] already know}[t-n]. 

{Is[x] it[s] worth the effort}[t-n-nq]? {If your writing shows[v] any of the problems below}[f-cd], {(x-word grammar)[s] can[x] help[v] you fix them}[t-n]. 

 - run-on sentences
 - comma splices
