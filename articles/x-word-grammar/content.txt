# Using X-Word Grammar to Read and Write Better

{If you (don't)[x] see[v] an x-word in a sentence}[f-cd], {it[s]('s)[x] hidden inside the main verb}[t-n]. {Only 3 x-words can[x] hide}[e-r]: {do[x], does[x] and did[x]}[extra]. {This[s] will[x] make[v] more sense}[t-n] {when you learn more x-word grammar}[e-t].
