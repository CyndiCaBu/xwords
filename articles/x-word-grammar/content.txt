# Using X-Word Grammar to Read and Write Better

{(Every complete sentence in English)[s] has[vxs] an x-word}[t-n].  {You[s] can[x] test[v] this by looking[ger] for the x-words}[t-n] {whenever you[s] read in English}[e-t]. 

{If you (don't)[x] see[v] an x-word in a sentence}[f-cd], {it[s]('s)[x] hidden inside the main verb}[t-n]. {Only 3 x-words can[x] hide}[e-r]: {do[x], does[x] and did[x]}[extra]. {This[s] will[x] make[v] more sense}[t-n] {when you learn more x-word grammar}[e-t].

{(Memorizing the x-words)[s] comes[vxs] first}[t-n]. Then[l] {you[s] can[x] look[v] for them in sentences and mark[v] them}[t=n]. {You[s] can[x] tap[v] or click[v] them here}[t-n]; {on paper}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] write[v] an X over them}[t-n].

{(Finding x-words)[s] is[x] a way (to find)[inf] subjects and verbs}[t-n], {step by step}[extra].

# Step 1

{Find[v] the x-word}[t-n].

# Step 2

{From the x-word}[f-p], {look[v] left (to find)[inf] the subject}[t-n-nq]. {Draw[v] a box around it}[t-n-nq].

# Step 3

{From the x-word}[f-p], {look[v] right (to find)[inf] the verb}[t-n-nq]. {Write[v] a V over it}[t-n-nq].

# Practice, practice, practice

{After practicing[ger] these first steps}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] use this knowledge (to learn)[inf] sentence patterns}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] only 7 basic sentence patterns in English}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] takes[vxs] time (to learn)[inf] them}[t-n]. 

# Is it worth the effort?

{With x-word grammar}[f-r], {you[s]('ll)[x] be[v] able to}[t-n-nq]:

 - read carefully (to understand)[inf] better, even when sentences are[x] long and complicated
 
 - make your writing[ger] sound more like English

 - read your own writing[ger] (to find)[inf] mistakes like run-ons, fragments, subject-verb agreement and verb form problems, and much more

# An open mind helps.

{If you[s]('re)[x] used to traditional English grammar}[f-cd], {(the terms we use in x-word grammar)[s] might[x] confuse[v] you}[t-n-nq] {at first}[e-t]. X-words? Trunks? Shifters? Linkers? Inserts? {With an open mind}[f-r], {you[s] will[x] get[s] used to these terms}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] will[x] probably notice[v] a lot of connections to what you[s] already know}[t-n]. Then[l] {you[s] can[x] use[v] x-word grammar as a tool (to help)[inf] you improve your reading[ger] and writing[ger]}[t-n].
