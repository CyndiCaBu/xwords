<p> I <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> know how many times I<span class="xw ve_class">’ve</span> heard someone tell me that Haiti <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> have any trees, but that<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> clearly not true. Yes, Haiti <span class="xw has_class">has</span> suffered from years of deforestation, when trees <span class="xw were_class">were</span> cut down to make room for farms, houses, etc. However, as you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> see from the photo here, taken from the Hotel Montana in 2011, it <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be much more helpful to focus on reforestation than deforestation.</p>
<p> There <span class="xw are_class">are</span> many people who <span class="xw are_class">are</span> working on this process to make Haiti greener again, one tree at a time. Although NGOs (non-governmental organizations) <span class="xw are_class">are</span> often criticized for offering Haiti only short term solutions and doing the work that the government <span class="xw should_class">should</span> really do, no one <span class="xw can_class">can</span> deny the benefits of a tree-planting project, whatever its source <span class="xw may_class">may</span> be.</p>
<p> One NGO that <span class="xw has_class">has</span> worked in Haiti since 2006 <span class="xw is_class">is</span> called SOIL. The name <span class="xw is_class">is</span> an acronym for Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods, and the work they do <span class="xw is_class">is</span> both fascinating and useful. In one current project, SOIL joined another group called Trees Water People to plant 10,000 trees in Haiti. They <span class="xw are_class">are</span> using their unique form of compost to nourish these trees. Since local Haitian people <span class="xw are_class">are</span> involved at every level, the project <span class="xw should_class">should</span> have a high chance of success. Hopefully, it <span class="xw will_class">will</span> inspire more and more people to plant trees and take care of them, as a national treasure, valuable to all.</p>
