<p>The word “smog” refers to the type of air pollution that you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> often see in the sky over cities. As a word, smog <span class="xw has_class">has</span>  an interesting origin. It comes from 2 words that <span class="xw were_class">were</span> combined to make one: smoke + fog = smog. </p>
<p>There<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> a myth that smog <span class="xw has_class">has</span> a positive side. We all know that it <span class="xw is_class">is</span> absolutely not healthy; our cities <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be much better places to live if we <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> have so much air pollution. Yet some people claim that we <span class="xw can_class">can</span> thank smog for making urban sunsets more colorful. However, if you check the science, you<span class="xw ll_class">’ll</span> find that <span class="xw is_class">is</span> just not true. </p>
<p>The color we normally see in the sky <span class="xw is_class">is</span> a shade of blue, sometimes lighter and sometimes deeper or darker. That<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> because the sunlight <span class="xw is_class">is</span> made of a spectrum of colors. Imagine a rainbow, which goes from red and orange at one end to blue and violet at the other. Air molecules scatter the light, which means they separate it and make it go in different directions. Maybe this <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> make sense to you at the moment, but you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> see how this happens if you look at the sky and see how its color looks different as time passes, from early in the morning to later in the evening. Then think about what time it <span class="xw is_class">is</span> in other parts of the world. At the same exact moment on a summer day, the sky that looks light blue in Beijing, China at 8:00 in the morning <span class="xw might_class">might</span> look like this pink sunset in Queens, New York at 8:00 in the evening. </p>
<p>So what <span class="xw does_class">does</span>  all this have to do with smog? The smog particles usually  <span class="xw are_class">are</span> not all a similar size, so they <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> do a good job of scattering light. The truth <span class="xw is_class">is</span> that they often make the sky look hazy, or just a dull gray. Smog <span class="xw can_class">can</span> even block the sun, making the city look dirty. The places that <span class="xw are_class">are</span> known for truly colorful sunsets <span class="xw are_class">are</span> actually the tropics, deserts and open rural areas, where air pollution <span class="xw hasnt_class">hasn’t</span> contaminated the skies as much. What <span class="xw do_class">do</span>  you think? </p>
