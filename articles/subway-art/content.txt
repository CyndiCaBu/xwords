{In New York}[f-p], {(anyone who rides the subway)[s] has[vxs] a chance (to enjoy)[inf] a very informal art museum}[t-n] {at subway stations in each of the five boroughs}[e-p].  {Mosaics[s] are[x] the most common type of subway art}[t-n]. {Others[s] include[vxo] sculptures, sound installations and stained glass}[t-n]. {(Many of these projects)[s] were[x] commissioned[dtn] through a program called MTA Arts and Design}[t-n]. {(The MTAâ€™s website)[s] has[vxs] information about this}[t-n], {including pictures and audio of artwork, music and more}[extra].

{(The art in subway stations)[s] often reflects[vxs] the surrounding neighborhood}[t-n] - {either in the present or the past}[extra]. {For instance}[l], {at  the 81st Street station under the American Museum of Natural History}[f-p], {artists[s] have[x] created[dtn] designs of dinosaur bones, snails and other creatures}[t-p]. {Further downtown at 23rd Street on the Broadway line}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] try[v] (to fit)[inf] your head under one of the mosaic hats on the walls}[t-n]. {They[s] are[x] a tribute to the vaudeville and fashion business that thrived in that area long ago}[t-n]. 

{(Taking[ger] a moment to notice the art in the subway)[s] can[x] bring[v] positive emotions like interest and joy}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] also a way (to practice)[inf] a character strength}[t-n], {appreciation of beauty and excellence}[extra].

{What kind of art have[x] you[s] noticed[dtn]}[t-p-nq] {in the subway system?}[e] {If you had[x] a chance (to ask)[inf] the artists some questions}[f-cd], {what would[x] you[s] ask[v]}[t-n-nq]? {If you could make art for a subway station}[f-cd], {what would[x] you[s] make[v]}[t-n-nq]?
