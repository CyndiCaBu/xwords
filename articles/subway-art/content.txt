 New Yorkers and visitors who ride the subway have a chance to enjoy a very informal art museum at subway stations in each of the 5 boroughs.  Depending where you go, you can find all kinds of art work, from mosaics to sculptures to sound installations and more. Many of these projects were commissioned through a program called Arts for Transit and Urban Design. You can read about it on the MTA’s website, which has pictures and audio of artwork, music and more.
The art in subway stations often reflects part of the past or present of the surrounding neighborhood.  For instance, at  the 81st Street station under the American Museum of Natural History, artists have created designs of dinosaur bones, snails and other creatures. Further downtown, at 23rd Street, there are all kinds of mosaic hats on the walls, as a tribute to the vaudeville and fashion business that thrived in that area long ago. If you’re in a playful mood while you’re waiting for the local train on the Broadway line there, you can stand under one of those hats and have your picture taken by a friend. You’ll look funny for a minute, but the picture might make you laugh later!
What kind of art have you noticed in the subway system? If you had a chance to ask the artists some questions, what would they be?
