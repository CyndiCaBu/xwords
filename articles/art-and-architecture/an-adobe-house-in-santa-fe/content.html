<p> Santa Fe, New Mexico <span class="xw is_class">is</span> a small city in the southwestern part of the United States. It<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> located 7,000 feet above sea level, at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains. The sun shines most of the year, and the air <span class="xw is_class">is</span> considered clean. There <span class="xw are_class">are</span> state and national parks where you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> go hiking and learn about the history of the area, including the desert and the forests.</p>
<p>In the desert, the sun heats the air during the day. It <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be uncomfortable and even dangerous to be outside without protection from the bright light and incredible heat. However, the temperature drops as the sun goes down, and nights <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be quite cold. The difference between the high and low temperatures in a single 24-hour period <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be as much as 40 degree Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>To live in a place like that, it <span class="xw would_class">would</span> make sense to build the type of house that takes advantage of the desert’s natural temperatures. People <span class="xw have_class"> have</span> used traditional building materials like adobe for centuries to do this. In an adobe house, the thick walls absorb heat during the day and slowly give it back as the sun goes down. Inside, it feels cool, especially if the roof <span class="xw is_class">is</span>  painted white to reflect the sun.</p>
<p>We <span class="xw should_class">should</span> probably keep the lessons of an adobe house in mind as the climate changes. Why <span class="xw would_class">would</span>  anyone want to use electricity and spend money for air conditioning when they <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> need to? Why <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> more buildings have roofs that <span class="xw are_class">are</span> painted to reflect the sun? Why <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span>  more buildings have solar panels to turn the sun into useful energy?  When <span class="xw will_class">will</span> more building owners invite farmers to plant crops on their rooftops whenever possible, using rainwater and sunlight to create food? These <span class="xw are_class">are</span> all questions to keep in mind as the climate changes. We <span class="xw should_class">should</span> look at what <span class="xw has_class">has</span> and <span class="xw hasnt_class">hasn’t</span> worked well in the past to help us find creative solutions for the present and future.</p>
