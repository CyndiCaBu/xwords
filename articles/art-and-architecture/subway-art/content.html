<p> New Yorkers and visitors who ride the subway <span class="xw have_class">have</span> a chance to enjoy a very informal art museum at subway stations in each of the 5 boroughs.  Depending where you go, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> find all kinds of art work, from mosaics to sculptures to sound installations and more. Many of these projects <span class="xw were_class">were</span> commissioned through a program called Arts for Transit and Urban Design. You <span class="xw can_class">can</span> read about it on the MTA’s website, which <span class="xw has_class">has</span> pictures and audio of artwork, music and more.</p>
<p>The art in subway stations often reflects part of the past or present of the surrounding neighborhood.  For instance, at  the 81st Street station under the American Museum of Natural History, artists <span class="xw have_class">have</span> created designs of dinosaur bones, snails and other creatures. Further downtown, at 23rd Street, there <span class="xw are_class">are</span> all kinds of mosaic hats on the walls, as a tribute to the vaudeville and fashion business that thrived in that area long ago. If you<span class="xw re_class">’re</span> in a playful mood while you<span class="xw re_class">’re</span> waiting for the local train on the Broadway line there, you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> stand under one of those hats and <span class="xw have_class">have</span> your picture taken by a friend. You<span class="xw ll_class">’ll</span> look funny for a minute, but the picture <span class="xw might_class">might</span> make you laugh later!</p>
<p>What kind of art <span class="xw have_class">have</span> you noticed in the subway system? If you <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a chance to ask the artists some questions, what <span class="xw would_class">would</span> they be?</p>
