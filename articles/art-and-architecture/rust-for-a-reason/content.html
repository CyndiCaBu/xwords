<p>One thing that <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn't</span> change about New York City <span class="xw is_class">is</span> the fact that it<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> always changing. That<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> especially true in terms of construction. Old buildings <span class="xw are_class">are</span> demolished and new ones <span class="xw are_class">are</span> built. In some cases, the old and the new <span class="xw are_class">are</span> joined in a unique way. In the case of the building pictured here, it looks like someone <span class="xw has_class">has</span> stuck a new metal structure on the top of an old brick building. It <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be easy to laugh or scoff at the way the metal looks like it<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> rusting, but that <span class="xw was_class">was</span> done on purpose. There<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> another building in Long Island City with a similar color and texture. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> covered with a metal known as Cor-Ten steel, which <span class="xw was_class">was</span> designed to rust in a beautiful or at least interesting way. The idea <span class="xw is_class">is</span> that you <span class="xw would_class">would</span> never need to paint a building if you <span class="xw could_class">could</span> simply appreciate its lovely rusted surface.</p>
<p>The steel structure pictured here <span class="xw is_class">is</span> in DUMBO, a neighborhood in Brooklyn near the Manhattan Bridge.  When I took the picture, I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> fascinated by the way it looks like it<span class="xw s_class">'s</span> hanging in the sky. I wondered when it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> built and why. <span class="xw could_class">Could</span> it be a stairwell? <span class="xw is_class">Is</span> it fully enclosed, or <span class="xw does_class">does</span> it really have some openings for air to flow through? If so, what happens when it rains? Finally, I <span class="xw would_class">would</span> like to know if I <span class="xw could_class">could</span> visit that funny structure on a beautiful day, to spend some time safely hanging out in the clouds. A friend of mine <span class="xw would_class">would</span> probably suffer from vertigo there, but I think I<span class="xw d_class">'d</span> enjoy it. Who <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you identify with more, me or my friend?</p>
