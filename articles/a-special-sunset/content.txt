"Look up," {(the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson)[s] often says[vxs]}[t-n-nq]. {It[s]('s)[x] a reminder (to appreciate)[infinitive] what we can[x] see in the sky}[t-n], {no matter where we are[x]}[extra].

{In most of Manhattan}[f-p], {skyscrapers[s] make[vxo] it hard (to see)[infinitive] the sky well}[t-n]. However[l], {a few times a year}[f-t], {(the tall buildings)[s] are[x] part of a special effect}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] called[dtn] Manhattanhenge}[t-n], {a term that Dr. Tyson made[vxd] popular}[extra].

{Also known as the Manhattan solstice}[extra], {Manhattanhenge[s] is[x] when the sunset fills the space between buildings on certain east-west streets}[t-n]. {It[s] looks[vxs] like a big ball of light falling in slow motion}[t-n]. {(Crowds of people)[s] gather[vxo] (to watch)[inf] and take pictures}[t-n].

(One summer)[f-t], {(two friends)[s] decided[vxd] (to watch)[inf] Manhattanhenge from Queens}[t-p]. {They[s] were[x] waiting[v] for a bus}[t-p] {in Long Island City}[e-p], {headed[dtn] to the East River}[extra]. {They[s] planned (to take)[inf] pictures}[t-p] {from a park in across from the United Nations building}[e-p]. 

{At that time}[f-t], {there[s] was[x] a famous graffiti-covered art center called 5 Pointz in Long Island City}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] across the street from the bus stop}[t-p]. {(A man)[s] was[x] playing[v] the guitar in front of 5 Pointz}[t-p], and[j] {(some people)[s] were[x] taking[v] photos of him and filming[v] a video}[t-p]. 

{(The friends on their way to Manhattanhenge)[s] (didnâ€™t)[x] have[v] time (to ask)[inf] the musician for his name}[t-p-nq]. {(The bus)[s] came[vxd]}[t] {while they were[x] taking his picture}[e-t], and[j] {they[s] (were)[x] in a hurry (to reach)[inf] the river and see the sun go down between the buildings}[t-p]. 

Unfortunately[l], {they[s] (didn't)[x] get[v] good photos of Manhattanhenge}[t-p-nq]. Instead[l], {they[s] got[vxd] this image of a man and some graffiti in the late afternoon sun at 5 Pointz}[t-p]. {If you go[vxo] to the same location now}[f-cd], {you[s]('ll)[x] find[v] towers of glass and steel}[t-n]. {Everything[s] changes[vxs]}[t-n] - {even the sun}[extra].
