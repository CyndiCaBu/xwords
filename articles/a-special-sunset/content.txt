"Look up," {(the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson)[s] often says[vxs].}[t] {It[s]('s)[x] a reminder (to appreciate)[infinitive] what we can[x] see in the sky,}[t] {no matter where we are[x].}[extra]

{In most of Manhattan,}[f] {skyscrapers[s] make[vxo] it hard (to see)[infinitive] the sky well.}[t] However,[l] {a few times a year,}[f] {(the tall buildings)[s] are[x] part of a special effect.}[t] {It[s]('s)[x] called[dtn]
 Manhattanhenge,}[t] {a term that Dr. Tyson made[vxd] popular.}[extra]
