On the night of Manhattanhenge, we were waiting for a bus in Queens with a camera ready to take pictures of the setting sun. The whole point of Manhattanhenge is to watch the sun lining up perfectly with the east-west streets in Manhattan as it sets. In other words, depending on the weather, the sun can look like a big red or orange ball falling exactly between tall buildings. This phenomenon doesn’t happen often; Manhattanhenge is only 4 times a year.
While we were on the way to take pictures of the sunset, there were a couple of people waiting near us and a few more across the street from the bus stop. One was a man playing the guitar and the others were taking photos of him and maybe making a video, too. They were all in front of 5 Pointz, the famous graffiti-covered art center in Long Island City. We don’t know who the man playing the guitar was, but we liked the way he looked in the late afternoon sun and we enjoyed his music. Unfortunately, we didn’t get a chance to ask him for his name, because the bus came after we had only taken a couple of pictures. We didn’t want to miss it, since the sun was going to set in about an hour and a half.
The reason you can see a picture of the guitar player here instead of the sunset is that we didn’t get good pictures of Manhattanhenge after all. Maybe we’ll have better luck next time.
