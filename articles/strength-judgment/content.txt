{Judgment[s] is[x] a character strength related to wisdom}[t-n]. {It[s](’s)[x] not about judging[ger] based on your opinions}[t-n-nq](;)[j] {it[s]('s)[x] about considering[ger] different points of view}[t-n]. {Judgment[s] depends[vxs] on being[ger] open-minded so that you[s] can[x] look for evidence}[t-n], {including details}[extra]. {It[s] lets[vxs] you explore different options (to see)[inf] which one seems the most logical}[t-n] - {even if it[s](’s)[x] not what you want}[extra].

{You[s] can[x] practice[v] judgment}[t-n] {when you[s] analyze a situation carefully before making[ger] a big decision}[e-t]. {It[s](’s)[x] also part of everyday life}[t-n], {as Nelly showed when her adult children took her out for Korean food}[e-t]. {They[s] recommended[vxd] a dish called bibimbap and explained[vxd] what it was}[t=p]. {It[s] would[x] come[vxd] to the table with piles of colorful vegetables spread out in a big bowl and a fried-egg on top}[t-n], {sunny-side up}[extra]. {There[s] would[x] be[v] a smaller bowl of rice on the side for Nelly to mix in}[t-n], {along with hot pepper sauce, they said}[extra].

{She[s] was[x] skeptical}[t-p] {because she had[x] trouble with spicy food}[e-r]. {(Her face)[s] turned[vxd] red}[t-p], and[j] {(her nose)[s] started[vxd] running[ger]}[t-p] {whenever she ate anything hot}[e-r]. {(Her children)[s] assured[vxd] Nelly that she would[x] like the taste of bibimbap}[t-p]. {It[s] (wouldn't)[x] be too spicy if she only added a little hot pepper paste}[t-p], {they insisted}[extra].

{Nelly[s] checked[vxd] the menu}[t-p], {looking[ger] for details before deciding[ger]}[extra]. {She[s] recognized[vxd] most of the vegetables listed}[t-p]: {zucchini, carrots and scallions, as well as spinach, mushrooms and cucumber}[extra]. {There[s] was[x] just one that was familiar but surprising[ger]}[t-p]: platycodon[extra]. {To her}[l], {that[s] was[x] a flower that she grew in the garden}[t-p](;)[j] {she[s] (didn't)[x] even know[v] it was[x] edible}[t-p]. 

Curious[extra], {she[s] kept[vxd] an open-mind and ordered[vxd] the bibimbap}[t=p]. {She[s] followed[vxd] her instincts and put[vxd] less of the hot pepper sauce than other people}[t=p], {understanding their tastes were different from hers}[extra]. {With a mix of soy sauce and sesame oil, plus a hint of garlic and the crunch of toasted sesame seeds}[extra], {(the bowl of vegetables and rice)[s] was[x] delicious}[t-p] -  {including the platycodon stalks}[extra].
