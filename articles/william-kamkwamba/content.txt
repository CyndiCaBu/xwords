Note: {(William Kamkwanba)[s] grew[vxd] up in rural Malawi}[t-p], {where hardship inspired him to become a problem-solver}[extra]. {(His strengths)[s] include[vxo] teamwork, love of learning and leadership}[t-n]. {Using these inner resources, a diagram in a library book, and scraps from a junkyard}[extra], {he[s] managed[vxd] (to build)[inf] a windmill for electricity and irrigation in his village}[t-p]. {He[s]  shared[vxd] his story with others on the radio and later in a TED Talk that changed his life}[t-p]. {He[s] accepted[vxd] an offer (to finish)[inf] high school at the African Leadership Academy in South Africa}[t=][t-p]. {While he was still studying there}[f-t], {he[s] collaborated[vxd] with Bryan Mealer (to write)[inf] a book about his life[t-p]. {(The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind)[s] helped[vxd] his story spread further}[t-p]. {Kwamkwamba[s] ended[vxd] up moving even farther from his home in Malawi}[t-p], {spending a few years at Dartmouth}[extra], {a prestigious college in the U.S.}[extra]. {He[s] majored[vxd] in environmental studies with a minor in engineering and graduated[vxd] with a bachelor's degree[vxd]}[t=][t-p]. {After college}[f-t], {he[s] moved[vxd] back home to Malawi}[t-p] (to continue)[inf] serving his community}[e-r]. {(His projects)[s] there include[vxo] not only a water pump that can run on a solar panel or a car battery but also a finance plan connecting farmers to supermarkets and farmers' children to schools}[t-n]. 

{In an English course in New York}[f-p], {(a student named DM)[s] read[vxd] Kamkwamba's book and wrote[vxd] the essay below in response}[t=][t-p].  {(Ben Nabors)[s] directed[vxd] and produced[vxd] a documentary film about Kamkwamba called William and the Windmill}[t=][t-p]. {He[s] kindly provided[vxd] the photo here}[t-p].

{(Becoming a hero)[s] (doesn’t)[x] mean[v] only being a person who does[x] something special in a war}[t-p]. {(What is important for a hero)[s] is[x] sacrificing[v] part of one’s own life (to help)[inf] provide a better and easier life for other people}[t-n-nq]. {(William Kamkwamba)[s], (a citizen of Malawi)[extra], is[x] a great example of someone who believed in himself and struggled (to defeat)[inf] adversity}[t-n-nq].

{As a 14-year-old boy}[extra], {William[s] had[vxd] (to leave)[inf] school}[t] {because his parents didn’t have enough money (to pay)[inf] for it}[e]. {After that}[f], {Kamkwamba[s] decided[vxd] (to teach)[inf] himself by going to his village’s library}[t], {which had[x] textbooks from Malawi, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe}[extra]. {He[s] found[vxd] the same books that students were reading in his former school}[t], so[j] {he[s] borrowed[vxd] them and asked[vxd] his friends (to give)[inf] him updates on what they had done in class each day}[t=][t-p]. {(A few science books)[s] caught[vxd] his attention}[t=p], {especially when he saw pictures that showed how things work}[extra]. {(Reading in English)[s] was[x] hard}[t], but[j] {he[s] really liked[vxd] science}[t]. {He[s] soon began[vxd] learning more and more about energy and how windmills could produce it.}[t] {By studying something that he had never learned before}[f], {William[s] developed[vxd] confidence in himself and realized[vxd] that he could[x] actually build a windmill}[t=][t-p-nq]. {He[s] started[vxd] going to the junkyard next to his high school (to find)[inf] all the parts he needed}[t-p], {like an old wheel from a bicycle, a couple pieces of wood, plates of metal and more}[extra]. {He[s] kept[vxd] going}[t-p], {even when people made fun of him}[extra]. {His[s] was[x] experimental}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] let[vxd] him power an electric light bulb that he put way up at the top of the windmill}[t-p]. {(People in the village)[s] noticed[vxd] the light from a distance and started[vxd] changing their opinion about him}[t=][t-p]; {he[s] seemed[vxd] quite intelligent and skillful}[t-p], {not crazy after all}[extra]. {Thanks to his windmill}[l], {(William’s family)[s] was[x] able (to use)[inf] simple electrical things like a light bulb}[t-p], so {they[s] could[x] read[v] and study[v] at night}[t-p].

{After a Malawian newspaper wrote about William and his windmill and some bloggers from America and Nigeria shared his story}[f], {(more and more people)[s] learned[vxd] about his work}[t-p]. Soon[l] {people[s] began[vxd] helping him}[t-p-nq], and[j] {they[s] found[vxd] ways for him (to study)[inf] in school again}[t-p]. {He[s] was[x] chosen[dtn] (to speak)[inf] at a TEDGlobal talk in Arusha, Tanzania}[t-p]. {It[s] changed[vxd] his life}[t-p] {through the connections it helped him make and the donations he could[x] use for his family and his village}[e-r]. Later[l] {he[s] created[vxd] a second windmill and set[vxd] up more light bulbs and some solar systems}[t=][t-p] {(His work)[s] let[vxd] his family pump water from the ground}[t-p]. {(The whole village)[s] came[vxd] to his house}[t-p] {(to get)[inf] water (to drink)[inf] and irrigate their fields}[e-r].

{(William’s hard work studying science books and building his first windmill)[s] was[x] a key to his success in life}[t-p]. Maybe[l] (the windmill he created from garbage)[s] (wasn’t)[x] so professional}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] made[vxd] all the villagers’ lives easier}[t-p]. {He[s] found[vxd] a lot of support (to help)[inf] him study more and more}[t-p], {first in special programs in Africa and eventually at Dartmouth}[extra], {a prestigious college in the United States}[extra].

{(William Kamkwamba)[s] became[vxd] a hero in his village}[t-p], {showing that if we have goals in life, we have (to do)[inf] everything to reach them}[extra]. {He[s] opened[vxd] a new way for the next generation in his village}[t-p]. {(Everyone who knows him there)[s] will[x] tell[v] their children about the young man who decided (to change)[inf] his life for the better}[t-n], and[j] {through hard work,}[f] {he[s] actually did[x]}[t-p-nq].
