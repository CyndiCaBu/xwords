{(Becoming a hero)[s] (doesn’t)[x] mean[v] only being a person who does[x] something special in a war.}[t] {(What is[x] important for a hero)[s] is[x] sacrificing part of one’s own life (to help)[inf] provide a better and easier life for other people.}[t] {(William Kamkwamba)[s](, a citizen of Malawi,)[extra] is[x] a great example of someone who believed in himself and struggled (to defeat)[inf] adversity.}[t]

{As a 14-year-old boy,}[extra] {William[s] had[vxd] (to leave)[inf] school}[t] {because his parents (didn’t)[x] have[x] enough money (to pay)[inf] for it[s].}[e] {After that,}[f] {Kamkwamba[s] decided[vxd] (to teach)[inf] himself by going to his village’s library,}[t] {which had[x] textbooks from Malawi, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe.}[extra] {He[s] found[vxd] the same books that students were[x] reading in his former school,}[t] so[j] {he[s] borrowed[vxd] them and asked[vxd] his friends (to give)[inf] him updates on what they had[x] done in class each day.}[t] {(A few science books)[s] caught[vxd] his attention,}[t] {especially when he saw pictures that showed how things work.}[extra] {(Reading in English)[s] was[x] hard,}[t] but[j] {he[s] really liked[vxd] science,}[t] and[j] {he[s] soon began[vxd] learning more and more about energy and how windmills could[x] produce it.}[t]
{By studying something that he had[x] never learned before,}[f] {William[s] developed[vxd] confidence in himself and realized[vxd] that he could[x] actually build a windmill.}[t] {He[s] started[vxd] going to the junkyard next to his high school (to find)[inf] all the parts he needed,}[t] {like an old wheel from a bicycle, a couple pieces of wood, plates of metal and more.}[extra] {He[s] kept[vxd] going,}[t] {even when people made fun of him.}[extra] {His[s] was[x] experimental,}[t] but[j] {it[s] let[vxd] him power an electric light bulb that he put way up at the top of the windmill.}[t] {(People in the village)[s] noticed[vxd] the light from a distance and started[vxd] changing their opinion about him;}[t=] {he[s] seemed[vxd] quite intelligent and skillful,}[t] {not crazy after all.}[extra] {Thanks to his windmill,}[l] {(William’s family)[s] was[x] able (to use)[inf] simple electrical things like a light bulb,}[t] so {they[s] could[x] read[v] and study[v] at night.}[t]

{After a Malawian newspaper wrote about William and his windmill and some bloggers from America and Nigeria shared his story,}[f] {(more and more people)[s] learned[vxd] what he had[x] done.}[t] Soon[l] {people[s] began[vxd] helping him,}[t] and[j] {they[s] found[vxd] ways for him (to study)[inf] in school again.}[t] {He[s] was[x] chosen[dtn] (to speak)[inf] at a TEDGlobal talk in Arusha, Tanzania.}[t] {It[s] changed[vxd] his life}[t] {through the connections it helped him make and the donations he could[x] use for his family and his village.}[e] Later[l] {he[s] created[vxd] a second windmill and set[vxd] up more light bulbs and some solar systems.}[t=] {(His work) let[vxd] his family pump water from the ground,}[t] {(to drink)[inf] and irrigate their fields.}[extra] {(The whole village)[s] came[vxd] to his house (to get)[inf] water.}[t]

{(William’s hard work studying science books and building his first windmill)[s] was[x] a key to his success in life.}[t] Maybe[l] (the windmill he created from garbage)[s] (wasn’t)[x] so professional,}[t] but[j] {it[s] made[vxd] all the villagers’ lives easier.}[t] {He[s] found[vxd] a lot of support (to help)[inf] him study more and more,}[t] {first in special programs in Africa and eventually at Dartmouth,}[extra] {a prestigious college in the United States.}[extra]

{(William Kamkwamba)[s] became[vxd] a hero in his village,}[t] {showing that if we have[x] goals in life we have[x] (to do)[inf] everything to reach them.}[extra] {He[s] opened[vxd] a new way for the next generation in his village.}[t] {(Everyone who knows him there)[s] will[x] tell[v] their children about the boy who decided (to change)[inf] his life for the better,}[t] and[j] {through hard work,}[f] {he[s] actually did[x].}[t]
