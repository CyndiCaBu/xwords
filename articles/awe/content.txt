{Awe[s] is[x] part of the word awesome}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] a powerful feeling of something vast}[t-n], {something bigger than us}[extra]. {It[s] can[x] help[v] us feel more connected to other people}[t-n], {inspiring[ger] us (to be)[inf] more generous and helpful}[extra]. {It[s] can[x] also change[v] how we understand something}[t-n]. 

{(A positive experience of awe)[s] might[x] give[v] us goosebumps and a tingling sensation}[t-n-nq]. {Think of the feeling of looking out on the view from high up on a mountain}[t-n-nq], { or the delight of a rainbow after a storm}[extra]. {(That type of awe)[s] is[x] a mix of wonder and respect}[t-n]. 

{We[s] also feel[vxo] this}[t-n] {when we admire other people for their virtues or skills}[f]. {If you have[x] ever had[v] a powerful, positive reaction to music, a work of art, or a moment in sports}[f], {you[s] have[x] been[dtn] in awe of what others could[x] do[v]}[t-b]. Likewise[l], {(spiritual and religious experiences)[s] can[x] be[v] positive sources of awe}[t-n], and[j] {ways to include it in our daily lives}[extra]. 

{(The type of awe we might not want to cultivate)[s] is[x] more negative}[t-n-nq]. {Mixing respect with fear and a sense of threat}[f], {(a negative experience of awe)[s] give[vxs] us chills and may even make[v] us shiver for a moment}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] is[x] a common experience}[t-n] {during a volcanic eruption or a hurricane}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] be[v] awed by the power of a natural disaster as it happens and in the destruction that it leaves behind}[t-n].

{(A team of scientists exploring the Pacific Ocean)[s] had[vxd] plenty of opportunities (to experience)[inf] both positive and negative awe}[t-p].  {They[s] were[x] doing[v] research for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S}[t-p], {sailing from Pago Pago to Honolulu}[extra].

{At times}[f] {(the weather)[s] was[x] dangerous}[t-p], {with strong winds and rough water}[extra]. {One night}[f], {(the NOAA ship)[s] went[vxd] right over the underwater mountain pictured above}[t-p]. {Even though the mountain is[x] almost 3000 meters high}[f], {it[s] is[x] so deep that the scientists could[x] only see[v] it with special technology}[t-p]. {The next morning}[f], {(the weather)[s] was[x] calm and beautiful}[t-p], and[j] {(the voyage)[s] was[x] almost over}[t-p].

{(Just imagining the peak of a mountain 2500 meters below the ocean surface, and then 3000 meters more to the ocean floor)[s] is[x] awe-inspiring}[t-n-nq]. {We[x] can[x] use[v] our memories and imaginations (to experience)[inf] positive awe as a relaxation technique}[t-n], {breathing in and out in a regular way}[extra].
 
{Another way (to study)[inf] awe in our own lives}[s] {is[x] (to keep)[inf] a journal of our experiences with it}[t-n-nq]. {Did[x] we[s] feel[v] awe with joy or with fear}[t-p-nq]? {Were[x] we[s] alone or with others}[t-p-nq]? Indoors or outside? In nature or not? {Taking notes of where we[s] were[x] and what we[s] were[x] doing[vg] when we felt awe}[s] {can[x] help[v] us understand it}[t-n-nq].
