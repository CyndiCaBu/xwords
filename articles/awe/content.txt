{Awe[s] is[x] part of the word awesome}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] a powerful feeling of something vast}[t-n], {something bigger than us}[extra]. {It[s] can[x] help[v] us feel more connected to other people}[t-n], {inspiring[ger] us (to be)[inf] more generous and helpful}[extra]. {It[s] can[x] also change[v] how we understand something}[t-n]. 

{As a positive feeling}[f], {awe[s] is[x] a mix of wonder and respect}[t-n]. {It[s] is[x] a common response to the beauty of nature}[t-n], {like when we see a rainbow after a storm or we climb to the top of a mountain and look out at the view}[extra]. {(Admiring a work of art or listening to music that we love)[s] can[x]  fill[v] us with awe}[t-n]. {When we appreciate someoneâ€™s skill or we admire their virtue}[f], {we[s] are[x] in awe of them}[t-n]. {(Spiritual and religious experiences)[s] can[x] be[v] positive sources of awe}[t-n], too[extra]. 

{On the other hand}[l], {awe[s] can[x] also be[v] a more negative feeling}[t-n]. {It[s] mixes[vxs] respect with fear}[t-n], {with a sense of threat}[extra]. {(A big storm)[s] brings[vxs] awe at its incredible power}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] be[v] awed by the destruction afterwards}[t-n], {or by another natural disaster like an earthquake or a fire}[extra]. 

{(Culture and other factors)[s] can[x] affect[v] how we feel awe}[t-n], but[j] {(some types of awe)[s] are[x] universal}[t-n]. {(A positive experience of awe)[s] might[x] give[v] us goosebumps and a tingling sensation}[t-n-nq]. {(A negative experience of awe)[s] may[x] give[v] us chills and even make[v] us shiver for a moment}[t-n-nq].

{One way (to study)[inf] awe in our own lives}[s] {is[x] (to keep)[inf] a journal of different types of awe}[t-n-nq]. {Where were[x] we[s]}[t-p-nq] and[j] {what were[x] we[s] doing[v]}[t-p-nq] {when we felt awe and joy}[e]? How about awe and fear, or awe and humility? {Were[x] we[s] indoors or outside}[t-p-nq]? Alone or with others? In nature or not?

Think of the underwater mountain in the image above. {(A team of scientists exploring the Pacific Ocean)[s] found[vxd] it deep below their ship}[t-p]. {They[s] were[x] doing[v] research for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S}[t-p]. {(Their trip)[s] gave[vxd] them plenty of opportunities (to experience)[inf] positive and negative types of awe}[t-p]. 

{At times}[f] {(the weather)[s] was[x] dangerous}[t-p], {with strong winds and rough water}[extra]. {One night}[f], {(their ship)[s] went[vxd] right over this underwater mountain}[t-p], {near Honolulu, Hawaii}[extra]. {Even though the mountain is almost 3000 meters high}[f], {it[s] is[x] so deep that they could[x] only see[v] it with special technology}[t-p]. {The next morning}[f], {(the weather)[f] was[x] calm and beautiful}[t-p].
