{How would[x] it[s] feel[v] (to hang)[inf] out on one of Manhattan's major avenues without all the cars, trucks and buses}[t-n-nq]? {You[s] can[x] find[v] out}[t-n] {through a special program called NYC Summer Streets}[e-r]. {An annual celebration of public space and warm weather}[extra], {it[s] encourages[vxs] people to  be physically active and spend time outside having fun}[t-n]. {(Summer Streets)[s] takes[vxs] place}[t] {on 3 Saturdays in August}[e-t].

{One year during Summer Streets}[f-t], {it was partly cloudy but still hot outside}[t-p]. {(Lots of people)[s] seemed[vxd] thrilled at the chance (to enjoy)[inf] Park Avenue and its downtown branch, (Lafayette Street)[extra], free of cars}[t-p]. {(People of all ages)[s] were[x] out}[t-p] {walking, riding bikes, zooming past on skateboards, etc.}[e-r] {(The city)[s] had[x]  organized[dtn] various rest stops along the way}[t-p], {with dance and fitness workshops, water stations, art projects, bike repair and much more}[extra].

{(The Foley Square rest stop)[s], (close to the Brooklyn Bridge)[extra], had[vxd]  several fun activities}[t-p]. {There[s] was[x] an amazing jump rope demonstration by a group of young people who had[x] clearly practiced their skills for years}[t-p]. {(An appreciative crowd)[s] was[x] watching[v] them}[t-p]. Meanwhile[l], {(other people)[s] were[x] waiting[v] (to try)[inf] a zip line}[t-p]. {(Another popular option)[s] was[x]  fitness testing}[t-p] {provided by a group called Asphalt Green}[extra]. {They[s] had[x]  set[v] up equipment like what you see in the photo above and invited people (to find)[inf] out if they were[x] as fit as a 5th grader}[t-p]. {Some people can[x] do what the man in the photo is[x] trying (to do)[inf]}[t-n], while[j] {others (can't)[x]}[t-n]. {In addition to strength-related factors}[f-r], {there[s] are[x] valid anatomical reasons for this difference}[t-n].
 
How about you? {If you[s] were[x]  offered[dtn] a choice between doing pull-ups, riding a zip line or jumping rope in a rhythmic, acrobatic way}[f-cd], {which would[x] you[s] rather try[v]}[t-n-nq]?
