{How would[x] it[s] feel[v] (to hang)[inf] out on one of Manhattan's major avenues without all the cars, trucks and buses}[t-n-nq]? {You[s] can[x] find[v] out}[t-n] {through a special program called NYC Summer Streets}[e-r]. {An annual celebration of public space and warm weather}[extra], {it[s] follows[vxs] examples first set in Bogot√°, Colombia and Paris, France}[t-n]. {It[s] encourages[vxs] people (to get)[inf] outside and have fun trying[ger] different physical activities}[t-n], {sharing[ger] the streets with respect instead of competing[ger] for space}[extra]. 

{In New York}[f-p], {(Summer Streets)[s] takes[vxs] place}[t-n] {on the first three Saturdays in August}[e-t]. {(Park Avenue and its downtown branch)[s], (Lafayette Street)[extra], are[x] closed[dtn] to motor vehicles}[t-n] {for six hours}[e-t]. {(The public)[s] is[x] invited[dtn] (to participate)[inf]}[t-n], {enjoying the car-free open space}[extra]. {Anyone[s] can[x] go[v]}[t-n], {for as long or as far as they want}[extra].
 
{One year during Summer Streets}[f-t], {it was partly cloudy but still hot outside}[t-p]. {(People of all ages)[s] were[x] out}[t-p] {walking[ger], riding[ger] bikes, zooming[ger] past on skateboards, etc.}[e-r] {(The city)[s] had[x]  organized[dtn] various rest stops along the way}[t-p], {with dance and fitness workshops, water stations, art projects, bike repair and much more}[extra].

{(Several fun activities)[s] were[x] going[vg] on simultaneously at the Foley Square rest stop}[t-p], {close to the Brooklyn Bridge}[extra]. {There[s] was[x] an amazing jump rope demonstration by a group of young people who had[x] clearly practiced their skills for years}[t-p]. {(An appreciative crowd)[s] was[x] watching[vg] them}[t-p]. Meanwhile[l], {(other people)[s] were[x] waiting[vg] (to try)[inf] a zip line}[t-p]. {(Another popular option)[s] was[x]  fitness testing[ger]}[t-p] {provided by a group called Asphalt Green}[extra]. {They[s] had[x]  set[v] up equipment like what you see in the photo above and invited people (to find)[inf] out if they were[x] as fit as a 5th grader}[t-p]. {Some people can[x] do what the man in the photo is[x] trying[vg] (to do)[inf]}[t-n], while[j] {others[s] (can't)[x]}[t-n-nq], {for valid anatomical reasons as well as fitness issues}[extra].
 
How about you? {If you[s] were[x]  offered[dtn] a choice between doing[ger] pull-ups, riding[ger] a zip line or jumping[ger] rope in a rhythmic, acrobatic way}[f-cd], {which would[x] you[s] rather try[v]}[t-n-nq]?
