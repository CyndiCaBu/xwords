This photo was taken on the last day of NYC's 2012 Summer Streets program.  Like other cities around the world, New York has celebrated public space and warmer weather by closing a major avenue for several hours and inviting the public to come out and play. 
Lots of people were thrilled at the chance to enjoy Park Avenue and its downtown branch, Lafayette Street, free of cars. There were people riding bikes, walking, zooming past on skateboards, etc. The city had  organized various rest stops along the way, with dance and fitness workshops, water stations, art projects, bike repair and much more.
The Foley Square rest stop was very close to the Brooklyn Bridge, and it had  several fun activities. There was an amazing jump rope demonstration by a group of young people who had clearly practiced their skills for years. An appreciative crowd was  watching them, while others were  waiting to try a zip line in front of a court house. Another popular option was  fitness testing, provided by a group called Asphalt Green. They had  set up equipment like what you see in the photo above and invited people to  find out if they were  as fit as a 5th grader.  Recent studies have  indicated that there are  valid anatomical reasons why some people can do what the man in the photo is trying to do and others can’t, but we won’t  get into that here.
How about you? If you were  offered a choice between jumping rope in a rhythmic, acrobatic way, riding a zip line or doing pull-ups, which would you rather try?
