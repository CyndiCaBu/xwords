{(This photo)[s] was[x] taken[v]}[t] {one year duing NYC('s)[x] Summer Streets program.}[e]  (Like other cities around the world,)[f] {(New York)[s] has[x] celebrated[v] public space and warmer weather by closing a major avenue for several hours and inviting the public (to come)[inf] out and play.}[t] 
{(Lots of people)[s] were[x] thrilled[dtn] at the chance (to enjoy)[inf] Park Avenue and its downtown branch,}[t] (Lafayette Street, free of cars.)[extra] {There[s] were[x] people riding bikes, walking, zooming past on skateboards, etc.}[t] {(The city)[s] had[x]  organized[dtn] various rest stops along the way}[t], (with dance and fitness workshops, water stations, art projects, bike repair and much more.)[extra]
{(The Foley Square rest stop)[s] was[x] very close to the Brooklyn Bridge,}[t] and {it[s] had[xvd]  several fun activities.}[t] {There[s] was[x] an amazing jump rope demonstration by a group of young people who had[x] clearly practiced their skills for years.}[t] {(An appreciative crowd)[s] was[x]  watching[v] them.}[t] Meanwhile,[l] {others[s] were[x]  waiting[v] (to try)[inf] a zip line in front of a court house.}[t] {(Another popular option)[s] was[x]  fitness testing,}[t] (provided by a group called Asphalt Green.)[extra] {They[s] had[x]  set[v] up equipment like what you[s] see in the photo above and invited people (to find)[inf] out if they were[x]  as fit as a 5th grader.}[t] {Studies[s] have[x]  indicated[dtn] that there are[x]  valid anatomical reasons why some people can[x] do[v] what the man in the photo is[x] trying (to do)[inf] and others (can't)[x]}[t], but[j] {we[s] (wonâ€™t)[x]  get[v] into that here.}[t]
How about you? (If you[s] were[x]  offered[dtn] a choice between jumping rope in a rhythmic, acrobatic way, riding a zip line or doing pull-ups,)[f] {which would[x] you[s] rather try[v]?}[t]
