People have grown and used sage for centuries. In some cultures, it’s associated with herbal remedies. Its essential oils may have some antimicrobial properties, but more research is needed to test that.


Sage is generally considered safe to eat, in moderation. Some people may have an allergic reaction to it, especially if they eat too much or for too long. There are many varieties of sage, and some species have a natural chemical compound that can affect the nervous system. In general, though, most people don’t have problems with sage. 


You can use this herb fresh or dried, in a sauce, main dish, beverage, etc. If you like the flavor or sage and you are a tea drinker, you could try throwing some sage leaves into your next pot of black tea. It will give the tea a different taste without being too strong. For a more intense flavor, you would need to boil the sage leaves with the tea leaves for a few minutes.


If you’d like to try sage, there are plenty of recipes online. Please keep science in mind and don’t believe every health claim you read. If you can’t prove results in a controlled experiment in a lab, how can you know if they are valid?
