{Pingyao[s] is[x] an ancient city}[t-n] {in northern China}[e-p]. {It[s]('s)[x] famous for its big city walls}[t-n], {wide enough to walk on with friends and high enough to offer a good view on both sides}[extra]. {(Various points on top of the wall)[s] give[vxo] historical information}[t-n], and[j] {(a museum at ground level)[s] presents[vxs] Pingyao's history as a financial center}[t-n]. {(The first system of cash deposits in one place and withdrawals in another)[s] started[vxd]}[t-p] {in a small building there}[e-p].

(As a UNESCO World Heritage site)[extra], {Pingyao[s] attracts[vxs] tourists}[t-n] {all year}[e-t]. {(The narrow sidewalks)[s] are[x] often full of vendors selling souvenirs and tourists wandering in and out of the shops and restaurants}[t-n]. {When we visited in 2014}[f-t], {(the sound of African drumming)[s] pulled[v] me into one shop where the young salesman and I shared a love of music}[t-p]. Meanwhile[l], {(my friends)[s] were[x] tempted[v] by a restaurant down the street}[t-n]. {They[s] wanted[v] (to try)[inf] Pingyao beef}[t-p], (thin slices of meat served with noodles and a traditional vinegar from that province)[extra]. 

{Besides Shanxi vinegar}[l], {(other traditions)[s] continue[v]}[t-n] (in Pingyao)[e-p]. {One[s] is[x] the collection of night soil}[t-n], {the kind most of us flush down the toilet}[extra]. {(The man and the mule pictured above)[s] were[x] going[v] around parts of the city (to collect)[inf] this waste in buckets}[t-p]. {They[s] probably took[v] it to a field outside the city for processing}[t-p]. {With the right conditions}[f-r], {(the sun)[s] would[x] make[v] it hot enough (to kill)[inf] any harmful microbes}[t-p]. Then[l] {farmers[s] could[x] use[v] it as fertilizer (to feed)[inf] their crops in an an efficient, closed system}[t-p]. {(The crops)[s] feed[v] the people}[t-n], and {(the people)[s] feed[v] the crops}[t-n].

{We[s] visited[v] Pingyao on a very hot day in August}[t-p]. {(The look on the mule’s face)[s] gives[v] a clue to the effort it was[x] making[v]}[t-n]. {(The job)[s] (can't)[x] be[v] easy for the animal or the human}[t-n], but[j] {it[s](’s)[x] essential}[t-n]. {Without a good sewer system}[f-cd], {what would[x] (those residents of Pingyao)[s] do[v] with all their waste}[t-n-nq]? {(The night soil man and his animal)[s] should[x] get[v] plenty of respect in their community}[t-n].
