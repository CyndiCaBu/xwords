{Pingyao[s] is[x] an ancient city}[t-n] {in China}[e-p]. {It[s]('s)[x] famous for its big city walls}[t-n], {wide enough to walk on with friends and high enough to offer a good view on both sides}[extra]. {(Various points on top of the wall)[s] give[vxo] historical information}[t-n], and[j] {(a museum at ground level)[s] presents[vxs] Pingyao's history as a financial center}[t-n]. {(The first system of cash deposits in one place and withdrawals in another)[s] started[vxd]}[t-p] {in a small building there}[e-p].

(As a UNESCO World Heritage site)[extra], {Pingyao[s] attracts[vxs] tourists}[t-n] {all year}[e-t]. {It[s] has[vxs] lots of shops and sidewalk vendors selling[ger] all kinds of souvenirs}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] restaurants with typical food from that part of northern China}[t-n], (Shanxi province)[extra].  {There[s] are[x] also houses and other signs that people still live there}[t-n], (in and around the ancient city)[extra].

{(Some of the old traditions)[s] continue[vxo]}[t-n] (in Pingyao)[e-p], {like the collection of night soil}[extra]. {(The man and the donkey in the photo)[s] were[x] going[vg] around the city in 2014 picking[ger] up human waste}[t-p]. {They[s] probably took[vxd] it to a field outside the city where it could[x] sit in the sun until it got hot enough (to kill)[inf] any harmful microbes}[t-p]. Then[l] {farmers[s] could[x] use[v] it as fertilizer (to feed)[inf] their crops}[t-p], (the same crops that would[x] feed the people who contributed the night soil)[extra]. {That[s]('s)[x] a good example of an efficient, closed system}[t-n].

{It[s] was[x] a very hot day in August}[t-p] {when this picture was[x] taken}[e-t]. {(The look on the donkey’s face)[s] is[x] probably a good clue to the effort it was[x] making[vg]}[t-n]. {(The job)[s] can't[x] be[v] easy for the animal or the human}[t-n], but[j] {it[s](’s)[x] essential}[t-n]. {Without a good sewer system}[f-cd], {what would[x] (the residents of Pingyao)[s] do[v] with all their waste}[t-n-nq]? {How could[x] they[s] take[v] care of it}[t-n-nq] {without the night soil man}[e-cd]? {(He and his animal)[s] should[x] get[v] plenty of respect in their community}[t-n]. {Do[x] you[s] think[v] they do[x]}[t-n-nq]?
