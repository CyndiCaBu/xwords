{Gratitude[s] is[x] a character strength that people all over the world practice}[t-n] - {but possibly not enough}[extra]. {It[s]('s)[x] what you feel}[t-n] {when you want (to say)[inf] "thank you" for all good things that happen}[e-t], {no matter how simple they might be}[extra].

{(Building your sense of gratitude)[s] can[x] increase[v] your well-being}[t-n], {helping you flourish}[extra]. {(One technique)[s] is[x] (to keep)[inf] a gratitude journal}[t]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] take[v] a lot of time}[t-n]. {At the end of the day}[f-t], {just spend[vxo] a few minutes writing down 3 good things that happened that day}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] do[v] this a few times a week}[t-n], {but not necessarily every day}[extra]. However[l], {you[s] need[vxo] (to make)[inf] it meaningful}[t-n]. {(Don't)[x] let[v] it become a chore}[t-n-nq]. Instead[l], {focus[vxo] on really feeling grateful}[t-n-nq]] {as you write in your gratitude journal}[e-t]. {If you do[x] that on a regular basis}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] end[v] up feeling happier as well}[t-n-nq].

{(One more trick to making a gratitude journal useful)[s] is[x] including your own role in making good things happen}[t-n]. Sometimes[l] {that[s] can[x] be[v] simple}[t-n] {such as recognizing your attitude of appreciation}[extra]. (For instance)[l], {(this picture)[s] was[x] taken[dtn] at a farmers market}[t-n] {on a cold day in New York}[e-t]. {It[s]('s)[x] from my digital gratitude journal}[t-n]. {I[s] had[x] missed[dtn] the farmers market in my own neighborhood}[t-p] {the day before I found this one by chance}[e-t]. {I[s] focused[vxd] on feeling grateful for my decision (to walk)[inf] down 23rd Street}[t-p].

{(Thinking about the context)[s] helped[vxd] me add more gratitude}[t-p]. {I[s] was[x] looking[v] for some good vegetables (to cook)[inf] for friends}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] wanted[vxd] (to get)[inf] them from an organic farm that I could[x] trust}[t-p]. {I[s] felt[vxd] lucky (to find)[inf] Roots to River farm}[t-p] {because the vegetables they were[x] offering looked fresh}[e-r]. {They[s] had[vxd] a variety of greens}[t-p], {including Swiss chard, kale and collard greens}[extra]. {(The green and purple cabbage)[s] looked[vxd] beautiful}[t], and[j] {so did[x] the radicchio}[extra]. {I[s] took[vxd] the time (to notice)[inf] that}[t-p] {which made me thankful later when I could[x] remember it clearly}[extra].

{I[s] was[x] expecting[v] the produce (to be)[inf] expensive}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] (didn't)[x] cost[v] as much as I thought it would[x]}[t-p]. {I[s] hoped[vxd] their prices were[x] fair to the workers who picked those vegetables too}[t-p]. {(Going to the farmers market)[s] always gives[vxs] me a lot (to think)[inf] about}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] one more source of gratitude}[t-n].
