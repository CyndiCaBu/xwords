Gratitude is a character strength that people all over the world seem to recognize. It&#8216;s what you feel when you want to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; for all the good things that happen.
One way to build your sense of gratitude is to keep a gratitude journal. You don&#8217;t need a lot of time. At the end of the day, just spend a few minutes writing down 3 good things that happened that day. You can do this a few times a week, but not necessarily every day. However, you need to make it meaningful. Don&#8217;t let it become a chore. Instead, focus on really feeling grateful when you write in your gratitude journal. If you do that on a regular basis, you might end up feeling happier as well.
One more trick to making a gratitude journal useful is including your own role in making good things happen. Sometimes that can be simple, such as recognizing your attitude of appreciation. For instance, this picture was taken at a farmers market on a cold day in New York. It&#8216;s from my digital gratitude journal. I had missed the farmers market in my own neighborhood the day before I found this one, so I was grateful for my decision to walk down 23rd Street.
I was looking for some good vegetables to cook for friends, and I wanted to get them from an organic farm that I could trust. I felt lucky to find Roots to River farm because the vegetables they were offering looked fresh. They had a variety of greens, including Swiss chard, kale and collard greens. The green and purple cabbage looked beautiful, and so did the radicchio. I took the time to notice that, which made me thankful later.
I was expecting the produce to be expensive, but it didn&#8217;t cost as much as I thought it would. Since community supported agriculture is a way to benefit farmers and their customers at the same time, I hope their prices were fair to the workers who picked these vegetables too. Going to the farmers market always gives me a lot to think about &#8211; one more source of gratitude.
