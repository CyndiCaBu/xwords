{Gratitude[s] is[x] a character strength that people all over the world practice}[t-n] - {but possibly not enough}[extra]. {It[s]('s)[x] what you feel}[t-n] {when you want (to say)[inf] thank you for all good things that happen}[e-t], {no matter how simple they might[x] be}[extra].

{(Building[ger] your sense of gratitude)[s] can[x] increase[v] your well-being[ger]}[t-n], {helping[ger] you flourish}[extra]. {(One technique)[s] is[x] (to keep)[inf] a gratitude journal}[t]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] take[v] a lot of time}[t-n]. {At the end of the day}[f-t], {just spend[vxo] a few minutes writing[ger] down 3 good things that happened that day}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] do[v] this a few times a week}[t-n], {but not necessarily every day}[extra]. However[l], {you[s] need[vxo] (to make)[inf] it meaningful}[t-n]. {(Don't)[x] let[v] it become a chore}[t-n-nq]. Instead[l], {focus[vxo] on really feeling[ger] grateful}[t-n-nq] {as you write in your gratitude journal}[e-t]. {If you do[x] that on a regular basis}[f-cd], {you[s] might[x] end[v] up feeling[ger] happier as well}[t-n-nq].

{(One more trick to making[ger] a gratitude journal useful)[s] is[x] including your own role in making[ger] good things happen}[t-n]. Sometimes[l] {that[s] can[x] be[v] simple}[t-n], {such as recognizing[ger] your attitude of appreciation}[extra]. (For instance)[l], {(this picture)[s] was[x] taken[dtn] in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador}[t-p]. {It[s]('s)[x] from Ahmed’s digital gratitude journal}[t-n]. {He[s] already felt[vxd] lucky (to be)[inf] on vacation there}[t-p], and[j] {he[s] was[x] thrilled[dtn]}[t-p] {when his friends invited him to go snorkeling[ger]}[e-t]. {He[s] took[vxd] a moment (to focus)[inf] on feeling[ger] grateful for those friends and for his own decision (to travel)[inf] with them}[t-p]. 

{(Thinking[ger] about the context)[s] helped[vxd] him add more gratitude}[t-p]. {He[s] had[x] been[dtn] planning[ger] on going[ger] to the beach}[t-p] {because he liked looking[ger] at shells and was[x] hoping[vg] to see different kinds from the ones he found at the Atlantic Ocean beaches}[e-r]. {Snorkeling[s] gave[vxd] him a different perspective}[t-p](;)[j] {he[s] was[x] delighted[dtn] (to see)[inf] starfish up close underwater}[t-p]. {He[s] tried[vxd] (to remember)[inf] what he(’d)[x] learned about them}[t=p]. {They[s] could[x] be[v] predators}[t-n], {eating[ger] mussels, clams and other fish, as well as prey, being[ger] eaten by gulls and other creatures}[extra]. {He[s] wondered[vxd]}[t-p] {if they were[x] the kind of starfish that can[x] regrow an arm if they lost one and checked[vxd] how many each had[x]}[t=p]: {five, five, five}[extra]. {He[s] was[x] grateful that he had[x] brought an underwater camera}[t-p], {knowing[ger] his pictures would[x] help[v] him savor memories of this trip later}[extra].
