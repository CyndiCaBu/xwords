{(One way (to build)[inf] your sense of gratitude)[s] is[x] (to keep)[inf] a gratitude journal.}[t] {It[s] (doesn't)[x] take[v] a lot of time.}[t] {At the end of the day,}[f] {just spend[vxo] a few minutes writing down 3 good things that happened that day.}[t] {You[s] can[x] do[v] this a few times a week,}[t] {but not necessarily every day.}[extra] (However,)[l] {you[s] need[vxo] (to make)[inf] it meaningful.}[t] {(Don't)[x] let[v] it become a chore.} (Instead,)[l] {focus[vxo] on really feeling grateful}[t] {as you write in your gratitude journal.}[t] {If you do[x] that on a regular basis,}[f] {you[s] might[x] end[v] up feeling happier as well.}[t]
