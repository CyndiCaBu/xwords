This is a trail between the Pacific and the Caribbean. It’s called the Camino de Cruces, or Trail of Crosses. A historic trail, it’s made of stones. It’s a trail where the Spaniards took the gold that they were carrying out of Peru, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. To be more specific, the Indians were the ones who carried the gold. Once it reached Porto Belo, in the Atlantic, it was shipped to Spain.
This trail hasn’t been lost in Panama. It’s been erased by all the new buildings, but part of it still exists. Finally, after looking for it for a long time, I decided to walk down it today, for 20 marvelous kilometers. Now I’m completely exhausted but so happy to have walked on it. One of the wonderful things is that when you walk, you have time to think of everyone, each and every person. Best wishes to all of you!
