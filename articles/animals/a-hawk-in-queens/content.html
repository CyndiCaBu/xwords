<p>Two things happened to me recently to remind me that nature <span class="xw is_class">is</span> with us everywhere, even in an urban environment. As I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> walking down the street with a friend, I felt my foot hit something lightly. I <span class="xw am_class">am</span> so glad that I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> wearing good sneakers, because when I looked down I saw a very small rat running away from us. It ran straight across our path and into a hole in the sidewalk. Although my friend and I walk down that street all the time, I <span class="xw had_class">had</span> never noticed that hole in the sidewalk before. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span> just a crack in the cement, next to a set of stairs, but it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> big enough for the rat to fit through.  It made me think about the creatures that live under our feet, the ones we <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span>  even know about.</p>
<p>The next morning I noticed a bird outside the kitchen window. It <span class="xw was_class">was</span>  sitting on a branch the way the mourning doves <span class="xw do_class">do</span>, but it looked much bigger. I wanted to take a picture, so I moved very slowly and carefully  in case it <span class="xw could_class">could</span>  sense my presence.  However, it flew away before I <span class="xw could_class">could</span>  get the camera ready. I decided to go outside to see if I <span class="xw could_class">could</span> find it somewhere. Luckily, it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> sitting in another tree nearby.  I got a few pictures of it sitting on the branch before it flew away again. I really hope that it found one of the local rats and <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a good meal.</p>
<p>I <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span>  know what type of hawk this <span class="xw is_class">is</span>, but I<span class="xw m_class">’m</span>  sure someone else <span class="xw does_class">does</span>. If you <span class="xw are_class">are</span>  a bird watcher or if you<span class="xw ve_class">’ve</span> studied birds and you <span class="xw can_class">can</span>  identify this one, please send us a comment to let us know.  Thanks!</p>
