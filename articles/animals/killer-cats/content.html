<p>Tigers <span class="xw are_class">are</span> often called big cats, for obvious reasons. With the shape of their bodies and the way they move, they look very similar to the types of cats humans <span class="xw have_class">have</span> lived with for thousands of years. We know that tigers and pet cats <span class="xw are_class">are</span> all carnivores; they <span class="xw can_class">can</span> eat all kinds of living creatures. Unlike tigers in the wild, pet cats <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> need to catch their own food to survive. They <span class="xw can_class">can</span> live happily on the dried or canned food that we humans feed them.</p>
<p>We usually think of tigers as the real killers, since they <span class="xw have_class">have</span> to kill if they <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> want to starve to death. However, a recent study of house cats who go outside showed that pet cats <span class="xw havent_class">haven’t</span> lost their killer instincts at all. Scientists estimate that as many as 12.3 billion mammals <span class="xw are_class">are</span> killed by cats in the U.S. every year. This includes more than the mice and rats that <span class="xw are_class">are</span> often seen as prey for cats. Other mammals, like squirrels and rabbits, <span class="xw are_class">are</span> also caught and killed by cats who get a chance to go outdoors. The number of birds killed by cats <span class="xw is_class">is</span> estimated at 2.4 billion, which <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> seem like good news at all. According to the study, it <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> matter if the cats <span class="xw are_class">are</span> fed by humans or not. Their instinct tells them to hunt; if they get the opportunity, they<span class="xw ll_class">’ll</span> follow that instinct.</p>
<p>Reading about this study reminded me of something I saw in my neighborhood a few years ago. I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> kind of shocked at the time, but now it makes sense. One day, as I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> walking near a house with an overgrown garden, I saw something moving in the tall grass. At first I thought it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> just a cat, but then I realized that the cat <span class="xw wasnt_class">wasn’t</span> alone. It <span class="xw had_class">had</span> another animal in its mouth. I <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> really want to see a rat, but I looked anyway. I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> surprised when I realized that it <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a squirrel. Until then, I <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> know that cats ate squirrels; I thought they limited themselves to birds, mice and rats. Of course that <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> make sense; omnivores eat what they <span class="xw can_class">can</span> find.</p>
<p>The important point about cats <span class="xw is_class">is</span> that their hunting instinct <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> disappear when we keep them inside as protected pets. Although we <span class="xw might_class">might</span> think it<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> good for them to get outside and <span class="xw have_class">have</span> some fun acting like wild little tigers, the study found that cats also get into dangerous situations outdoors, risking their health with our chemical wastes, traffic, etc. If you <span class="xw have_class">have</span> a cat and you <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> want it to get sick, you <span class="xw should_class">should</span> probably keep it inside and feed it yourself. Whether you want to think about insects in your home or not, your cat <span class="xw will_class">will</span> probably find a spider or something else to satisfy its hunting instincts.</p>
