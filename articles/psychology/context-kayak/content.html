<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> Good readers, like good language learners, know how to use the context to understand things. What <span class="does_class">does</span> context mean? We <span class="can_class">can</span> define it as the setting, which means the time and place where something happens. In terms of reading and writing, context includes the words or situations that you <span class="can_class">can</span> read and understand around other words that you<span class="re_class">’re</span>  trying to figure out.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">We use context in everyday life to understand what<span class="s_class">’s</span> going on around us. If you go to a bus stop and see a line of people waiting, you <span class="can_class">can</span> safely assume that the bus probably <span class="hasnt_class">hasn’t</span>  come for a little while, and the people <span class="are_class">are</span>  waiting for it. Now imagine that you see the same line of people waiting outside a movie theater. What <span class="do_class">do</span> you think they <span class="are_class">are</span> waiting for in this case? Of course you <span class="would_class">would</span> most likely be correct if you guessed that the line outside the movie theater <span class="is_class">is</span> for people who want to buy tickets, not get on a bus. The line <span class="is_class">is</span> the same in both cases, but the context <span class="is_class">is</span>   different.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Without enough information about the context, this photo of a kayak on the sidewalk <span class="may_class">may</span> look a little strange. If you walked by and saw it there, you <span class="might_class">might</span> think that someone <span class="was_class">was</span> trying to get rid of it, since people often put bags of trash out on the sidewalk in a similar location. You <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> do very much with a kayak on the grass, and you certainly <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> drive it down the street. However, if you recognize this part of Astoria, Queens, very close to Socrates Sculpture Park, you know that the East River <span class="is_class">is</span>  very close by. It <span class="would_class">would</span> make a lot more sense to see the kayak in the water, a logical context, than here on the grass. Context makes a difference.</p>
