<p><span class="xw dont_class">Don&#8217;t</span> let the title fool you. Positive psychology <span class="xw is_class">is</span> not the same as positive thinking. It <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn&#8217;t</span> deny reality. It <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn&#8217;t</span> pretend that you <span class="xw can_class">can</span> get whatever you want if you just think positive thoughts. What <span class="xw will_class">will</span> change if you <span class="xw dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> make a plan and take real steps to reach your goals?</p>
<p>Positive psychology <span class="xw is_class">is</span> a science, which means that it involves hard work and systematic study. It tries to define its terms. In other words, what <span class="xw does_class">does</span>  the word &#8220;positive&#8221; mean? If you study positive psychology because you want to be happy, what <span class="xw does_class">does</span> happiness mean? How <span class="xw can_class">can</span> we measure it? If someone says that they <span class="xw are_class">are</span> happy, how <span class="xw can_class">can</span> we know if that<span class="xw is_class">&#8216;s</span> true? If they <span class="xw are_class">are</span> in fact happy, how happy <span class="xw are_class">are</span> they? How <span class="xw do_class">do</span> we know?</p>
<p>What about you? <span class="xw are_class">Are</span> you happy? It <span class="xw might_class">might</span> seem like a simple question, but it<span class="xw is_class">&#8216;s</span> actually rather tricky. There <span class="xw are_class">are</span> many types of happiness. Some <span class="xw are_class">are</span> short-term and others last longer. When he taught an incredibly popular course in positive psychology at Harvard, Tal Ben-Shahar encouraged people to think about being happier now than before. Instead of asking if you<span class="xw re_class">&#8216;re</span> happy, think about whether you<span class="xw re_class">&#8216;re</span> happier now than you <span class="xw were_class">were</span> at some previous time. Nowadays, Ben-Shahar focuses on helping people increase both their happiness and well-being.</p>
<p>If you<span class="xw re_class">&#8216;re</span> asking what well-being <span class="xw is_class">is</span>, good for you! Like any term, we <span class="xw have_class">have</span> to define it. One of the psychologists who <span class="xw have_class">have</span> contributed to the development of positive psychology <span class="xw is_class">is</span> Martin Seligman. In his book <em>Flourish</em>, Seligman described a theory of well-being that <span class="xw has_class">has</span> 5 elements. Each element <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be measured, which <span class="xw is_class">is</span> part of what makes positive psychology a science. Well-being theory goes by the acronym PERMA; each letter stands for one of the elements.</p>
