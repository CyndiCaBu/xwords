<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="can_class">can</span> increase your well-being by showing kindness. Just keeping that in mind <span class="can_class">can</span> be a powerful tool. When you<span class="re_class">&#8216;re</span> having a hard time or feeling bored, instead of letting yourself focus on negative feelings, look around. Think about what you <span class="could_class">could</span> do to show kindness to someone else, even a stranger. Perhaps you <span class="could_class">could</span> find a way to treat yourself more kindly. Try to notice what happens next. What effect <span class="does_class">does</span> kindness have on your mood?</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Kindness <span class="may_class">may</span> be one of those simple steps we <span class="can_class">can</span> all take to make the world better, moment by moment. Sometimes we find ourselves showing it without even realizing it; kindness comes from our hearts. Here<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a story about it from a young man who loves to ride his bike long distances, WeiJie Tang. He told it in his own words and the pictures <span class="are_class">are</span> his, too.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The story happened just two years ago. I <span class="was_class">was</span> the team leader of our traveling team during that time. When we met this stray puppy, she followed our cycling team for about 10 miles. It <span class="was_class">was</span> incredible!</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">When we arrived at the hostel, she <span class="was_class">was</span> still following our team and just stayed at our door overnight. She <span class="had_class">had</span> an eye disease and looked so dirty. Some local people said she <span class="was_class">was</span> a very clever stray puppy, but nobody <span class="was_class">was</span> willing to take care of her.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Finally, we decided to travel with the dog. I took care of some heavy luggage that belonged to my friend, Lily. Then Lily put the dog on her bicycle. Because we <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> have a cage, we just put the puppy in the washbasin.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Fortunately, my other friend <span class="was_class">was</span> a doctor. He bought some medicine to treat the puppy&#8217;s eye disease. I made a simple cage for her, out of instant noodle boxes and rope. Because we <span class="were_class">were</span> just staying in a small village in Tibet, we <span class="could_class">could</span> not buy a cage. Meanwhile, I gave the puppy a new name &#8212; Sasa.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Our cycling team kept going through the mountains with our newest member riding in her box, on the back of Lily&#8217;s bike.<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">If we rode very slowly, Sasa <span class="would_class">would</span> get down and follow us.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This photograph <span class="was_class">was</span> taken on a very high mountain in Tibet, at an altitude of about 4,800 meters. Sasa <span class="was_class">was</span> wearing my sunglasses.<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Sometimes, Sasa <span class="would_class">would</span> be freezing when the weather <span class="was_class">was</span> bad. We <span class="would_class">would</span> rest for about half an hour if it <span class="was_class">was</span> rainy.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Sasa gave us more fun </p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Like us, Sasa saw a lot of beautiful scenery and traveled around Tibet. She always seemed sensible and intelligent.</p>p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Finally, our traveling team arrived at the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. This place <span class="is_class">is</span> very well known in China, like the Statue of Liberty in the USA. The building in the background <span class="is_class">is</span> the most well known building in Tibet; it<span class="is_class">'s</span> called the Potala Palace.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Eventually, I <span class="had_class">had</span> to leave, but I <span class="couldnt_class">couldn't</span> take a pet on the train or plane in China. Luckily, a temple of Lamaism promised that they <span class="would_class">would</span> adopt Sasa.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">We just gave her a bath and cleaned her up. During that time, I felt like I <span class="was_class">was</span> a failure!</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">I <span class="have_class">have</span> only been living in New York City for 1 year. Before I <span class="had_class">had</span> to leave China and come to the United States, I took an airplane to Lhasa to see Sasa one more time. I feel like she<span class="is_class">'s</span> part of my family, and I miss her so much when I write this. Nevertheless, I<span class="m_class">'m</span> glad to say that she<span class="is_class">'s</span> still healthy and happy.</p> href="http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths/Kindness">Kindness</a></p>
