<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">When you put a pot or pan on the stove, which way <span class="does_class">does</span> the handle face? It <span class="may_class">may</span> seem like a strange question, but if young children <span class="are_class">are</span> ever in the kitchen, the answer <span class="should_class">should</span> be easy. The handles always face inward, away from any small hands that <span class="might_class">might</span> reach up and accidentally spill something hot on the child below. Turning the handles away from the edge of the stove or counter <span class="is_class">is</span> a basic safety habit. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> something we <span class="do_class">do</span> all the time just to avoid trouble, like carrying scissors with the sharp tip pointing down, or staying away from the platform edge when waiting for a train. These <span class="are_class">are</span> all different ways to practice prudence, a character strength related to temperance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Prudence means being careful and using good judgment. It means you make wise decisions based on what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> good for you, or what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> right. For a construction worker, prudence <span class="can_class">can</span> mean the difference between health and injury, or even life and death. It <span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> an essential character strength. Wearing a hard hat <span class="might_class">might</span> not always be the most comfortable choice, but head injuries<br />
<span class="are_class">are</span> no fun either. Using a harness to attach to a lifeline, like the man in the photo <span class="was_class">was</span> doing, <span class="can_class">can</span> seem like a pain. However, there<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> a reason it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> called a lifeline.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The man pictured here <span class="is_class">is</span> probably about 6 feet tall. As he smiled for the camera, he explained some of the requirements of OSHA, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Whenever someone <span class="is_class">is</span> working at any height of 6 feet or more, they <span class="must_class">must</span> use something to stop them if they fall. The worker shown here pointed to the harness he <span class="was_class">was</span> wearing and explained how a shock-absorbing lanyard or a retractable lifeline <span class="could_class">could</span> protect him. He clearly knew how to be careful at work. His hardhat, harness, lifeline and even sunglasses <span class="can_class">can</span> all be seen as clues to his prudence.</p>
