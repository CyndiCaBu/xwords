<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Gratitude <span class="is_class">is</span> a character strength that people all over the world seem to recognize. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> what you feel when you want to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; for all the good things that happen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">One way to build your sense of gratitude <span class="is_class">is</span> to keep a gratitude journal. You <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> need a lot of time. At the end of the day, just spend a few minutes writing down 3 good things that happened that day. You <span class="can_class">can</span> do this a few times a week, but not necessarily every day. However, you need to make it meaningful. <span class="dont_class">Don&#8217;t</span> let it become a chore. Instead, focus on really feeling grateful when you write in your gratitude journal. If you <span class="do_class">do</span> that on a regular basis, you <span class="might_class">might</span> end up feeling happier as well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">One more trick to making a gratitude journal useful <span class="is_class">is</span> including your own role in making good things happen. Sometimes that <span class="can_class">can</span> be simple, such as recognizing your attitude of appreciation. For instance, this picture <span class="was_class">was</span> taken at a farmers market on a cold day in New York. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> from my digital gratitude journal. I <span class="had_class">had</span> missed the farmers market in my own neighborhood the day before I found this one, so I <span class="was_class">was</span> grateful for my decision to walk down 23rd Street.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">I <span class="was_class">was</span> looking for some good vegetables to cook for friends, and I wanted to get them from an organic farm that I <span class="could_class">could</span> trust. I felt lucky to find Roots to River farm because the vegetables they <span class="were_class">were</span> offering looked fresh. They <span class="had_class">had</span> a variety of greens, including Swiss chard, kale and collard greens. The green and purple cabbage looked beautiful, and so <span class="did_class">did</span> the radicchio. I took the time to notice that, which made me thankful later.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">I <span class="was_class">was</span> expecting the produce to be expensive, but it <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> cost as much as I thought it <span class="would_class">would</span>. Since community supported agriculture <span class="is_class">is</span> a way to benefit farmers and their customers at the same time, I hope their prices <span class="were_class">were</span> fair to the workers who picked these vegetables too. Going to the farmers market always gives me a lot to think about &#8211; one more source of gratitude.</p>
