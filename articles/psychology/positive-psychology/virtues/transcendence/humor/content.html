<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">One funny thing about humor <span class="is_class">is</span> that it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> universal, but also very cultural and even personal. Perhaps we all laugh in the same language, but you <span class="might_class">might</span> laugh at things that make other people roll their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Although a joke usually <span class="isnt_class">isn&#8217;t</span> very funny when you <span class="have_class">have</span> to explain it, that<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> not always true. Like so many things, it depends on the context. Some friends from Bosnia used to laugh whenever they <span class="were_class">were</span> finishing a phone call with someone and that person said, “Thank you for calling.” To an American, that sounds perfectly natural, but they explained that it <span class="was_class">was</span> hilarious to them. It just <span class="wasnt_class">wasn&#8217;t</span> something they <span class="were_class">were</span> accustomed to. It seemed quite silly to express gratitude for a simple phone call.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Friends from Argentina <span class="had_class">had</span> no problem enjoying sarcastic humor. On the other hand, friends from the Dominican Republic really <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> appreciate it. Sarcasm <span class="can_class">can</span> be a somewhat gentle push, like thanking your friend for coming early when he<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> actually half an hour late. It <span class="can_class">can</span> also be closer to an insult. In fact, a dictionary definition suggests bad intentions associated with sarcasm, like trying to hurt another person. However, people’s reactions to it depend on their overall relationship, as well as the tone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">What kind of humor <span class="do_class">do</span> you like? What <span class="was_class">was</span> the last thing that made you laugh? <span class="are_class">Are</span> you smiling now?
