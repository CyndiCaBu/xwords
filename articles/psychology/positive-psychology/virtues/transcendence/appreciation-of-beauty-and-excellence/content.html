<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This character strength <span class="has_class">has</span> a long name, but it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> not tricky to understand. It just means that you notice and appreciate beauty, excellence and/or skilled performance in all parts of life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">What <span class="do_class">do</span> you find beautiful? The answers <span class="might_class">might</span> depend on your experience, your education, your mood at the moment and other factors. <span class="do_class">Do</span> you see any beauty in this photo of people waiting to buy food on a sidewalk in Beijing? One person <span class="might_class">might</span> appreciate the tree, adding a touch of green life to an urban environment. Another <span class="might_class">might</span> take pleasure in the bright colors of the little yellow-orange food cart and the clothes worn by the man inside it. The people who <span class="were_class">were</span> actually there probably appreciated the skilled labor of whoever made their food. When people line up to buy dumplings from a certain vendor, it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> usually a sign that the food <span class="is_class">is</span> good. Delicious dumplings <span class="could_class">could</span> be an example of excellence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Taking the time to notice even simple expressions of beauty, excellence and skill <span class="can_class">can</span> help us feel good. It <span class="can_class">can</span> lift us out of a bad mood by helping us notice what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> good or strong instead of what<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> annoying or wrong. It<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> linked to the main focus of positive psychology: What<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> going well? What <span class="can_class">can</span> we do to flourish?</p>
