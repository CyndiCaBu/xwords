<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Perseverance means persistence, finishing what you start. When you face obstacles like difficulty or failure, it <span class="can_class">can</span> be hard to persevere, but that<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> the point. If perseverance <span class="is_class">is</span> one of your strengths, you keep trying until you reach your goal, whatever it <span class="may_class">may</span> be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">For Jaime, a college student majoring in environmental science, perseverance <span class="was_class">was</span> essential. He <span class="was_class">was</span> taking a biology course, and experience <span class="had_class">had</span> taught him to study hard. The previous semester, in another biology course, he <span class="had_class">had</span> failed one of the first quizzes. There <span class="were_class">were</span> so many new terms to learn, and they <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> come easily to him. Although some people grow up hearing words like humerus, radius and ulna, Jaime <span class="wasnt_class">wasn&#8217;t</span> one of them. English <span class="wasnt_class">wasn&#8217;t</span> his first language, so he <span class="was_class">was</span> still learning lots of words, not just in his biology course. It <span class="would_class">would</span> have been easy to blame the professor, who just stood in front of the class lecturing and showing too many slides to count. However, Jaime knew that it <span class="was_class">was</span> up to him to learn the material, no matter what. He knew he <span class="had_class">had</span> to persevere if he wanted to pass.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">After that disastrous quiz in his first biology course, Jaime found out he <span class="wasnt_class">wasn&#8217;t</span> the only one having trouble. Some of his classmates <span class="were_class">were</span> worried about their own scores, afraid they <span class="might_class">might</span> not pass. They started studying together almost every day, and Jaime decided to join them, hoping that <span class="would_class">would</span> help. He reviewed the material before their study sessions so that he <span class="wouldnt_class">wouldn&#8217;t</span> look like he <span class="didnt_class">didn&#8217;t</span> know anything. In the study group, everyone asked each other questions and explained in ways that made sense to them. By the second or third study session, Jaime felt comfortable explaining things to the others, which helped him reinforce what he <span class="was_class">was</span> trying to learn.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">They all <span class="did_class">did</span> well on the next quiz, but they <span class="had_class">had</span> to keep studying as often as they <span class="could_class">could</span> to get ready for the midterm. They spent more than twice as much time going over things together as they <span class="did_class">did</span> in class, but it <span class="was_class">was</span> worth it. Jaime and his study partners passed the class thanks to their mutual support. He kept that success in mind in the next biology course, and every hard course after that. Even if it seemed impossible in the beginning, with a lot of effort, he <span class="could_class">could</span> do it. He just <span class="had_class">had</span> to persevere.</p>
