<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Leadership involves taking action and serving as an example to others. A leader <span class="can_class">can</span> help motivate a group of people to do something and get along well while doing it. People <span class="can_class">can</span> show leadership, and so <span class="can_class">can</span> organizations. The One Acre Fund <span class="is_class">is</span> a good example, leading the way to help end extreme poverty by putting farmers first. The farmers themselves become leaders, training others and sharing what no one <span class="can_class">can</span> take away &#8211; knowledge. Here <span class="is_class">is</span> a blog written by the One Acre Fund training department in Kenya, and a picture of One Acre farmer Jacqueline Nasonja.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">More than half a century ago, the Green Revolution transformed much of the world, doubling or even tripling agricultural output and bringing food security and greater prosperity to millions of families.  The unsung heroes of that revolution <span class="were_class">were</span> agricultural extension (training) agents, traveling by bicycle, motorbike or foot down rural dirt roads, carrying better farming practices and better lives with them. These agents <span class="were_class">were</span> literally putting Norman Borlaug&#8217;s famous quote (&#8220;Take it to the farmer&#8221;) into practice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Despite the success of the Green Revolution in Asia and Latin America, it bypassed much of sub-Saharan Africa, where many rural farmers continue to use the same agricultural practices their forefathers used a century or more ago.  Today, university-educated agricultural extension agents with motorbikes or cars continue to travel down dirt roads doing incredible work, but <span class="are_class">are</span> massively outnumbered by the rural farmers who need them.  In 2006, One Acre Fund founder Andrew Youn saw this mismatch and proposed a different approach.  He realized that in order to bring &#8220;take it to the farmer&#8221; to the very last mile, a dense network of trainers <span class="was_class">was</span> needed to communicate complex skills and knowledge quickly and efficiently.</p></p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">For this role, Andrew envisioned the One Acre Fund field officer, a person like Joy Khisa (on the left in this photo).  A farmer herself, Joy <span class="has_class">has</span> always lived in the area of Kenya she serves.  She <span class="has_class">has</span> no university degree, no white Land Rover, no large salary.  But Joy works with 154 families in her community, meeting them once a week all year round, to train them on topics as diverse as new planting methods, the proper use of reusable sanitary pads, financial planning, and how to maintain your solar light.  Her impact and the impact of One Acre Fund Kenya’s 900 other field officers <span class="is_class">is</span> incredible: the average One Acre Fund farmer sees approximately 50 percent more income than a similarly-situated non-One Acre Fund farmer.  And Joy <span class="isnt_class">isn&#8217;t</span> leaving– she <span class="will_class">will</span> continue to work in her community, meeting the 154 families she works with once a week, every week, for many years to come.  This <span class="is_class">is</span> sustainable impact at scale.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Creating a simple, scalable, efficient training system for field officers like Joy <span class="is_class">is</span> the responsibility of One Acre Fund’s training department.  Our mission <span class="is_class">is</span> to empower our field officers to become the most impactful change agents they <span class="can_class">can</span> be in their communities.  To achieve that goal, we focus on two areas: the information chain and long-term staff development.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">One Acre Fund Kenya relies on a robust chain of information to transfer knowledge and skills quickly at scale.  On Monday, training materials <span class="are_class">are</span> sent to print.  By Tuesday, our nine senior field directors <span class="have_class">have</span> been trained.  By Wednesday, our 28 field directors <span class="have_class">have</span> been trained.  By Friday, our 200 field managers <span class="have_class">have</span> been trained.  By the following Monday, our 900 field officers <span class="have_class">have</span> been trained.  By the following Tuesday, 136,000 families across Kenya <span class="are_class">are</span> learning new information and skills. In just over a week, One Acre Fund <span class="is_class">is</span> able to reach thousands and thousands of families with life-changing knowledge.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">To support this chain, we use the One Acre Fund Integrated Training System.  Our training system combines a comprehensive Training of Writers course for curriculum developers, a three-month Training of Trainers course for our field team, field officer work planning tools that translate classroom concepts into a weekly agenda, and an assessment system that tests both field officer and farmer knowledge of our key concepts.  Our training system draws on best practices in adult education and active learning – brainstorming, case studies, role plays and similar strategies keep our team engaged, thinking critically and ready to solve any unexpected challenge they <span class="might_class">might</span> encounter in the field.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Our training system <span class="doesnt_class">doesn&#8217;t</span> stop at impactful trainings for farmers, though.  One Acre Fund’s field team <span class="is_class">is</span> not only for farmers, it<span class="is_class">&#8216;s</span> by farmers as well.  All nine of the senior field directors at the top of our information chain in Kenya started out as field officers– and many started out as farmer clients!</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">We use a comprehensive staff development curriculum that integrates the three parts of the 10/20/70 model to build skills rapidly through rigorous classroom exercise (10 percent), one-on-one mentorship (20 percent), and practical, real-world experience (70 percent).  Senior field directors <span class="may_class">may</span> manage over 100 staff, 100,000 US dollars in microfinance loans, and 30,000 clients.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">At One Acre Fund, we believe farmers <span class="are_class">are</span> the key to their own food security, prosperity, and sustainable development.  At the One Acre Fund Training Department, we work every day to help turn that belief into a reality.</p><p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Written by the <a href="https://www.oneacrefund.org/" target="_blank">One Acre Fund</a>.</p>
