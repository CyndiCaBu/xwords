<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The name Piaget means different things to different people. It brings memories of teaching and learning to anyone who <span class="has_class">has</span> studied developmental psychology or theories of learning. On the other hand, a person who loves a certain type of fine jewelry <span class="might_class">might</span> associate the name Piaget with a shop like the one in the photo.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Jean Piaget <span class="was_class">was</span> an educator and lifelong learner from Switzerland who inspired many others to think deeply about how people think and learn. When he <span class="was_class">was</span> young, Piaget studied natural sciences, but he <span class="is_class">is</span> known for his work in education. Instead of thinking of children as miniature adults, for instance, Piaget suggested that their brains work in a different way. A younger child <span class="has_class">has</span> a less logical way of thinking than an older one. That <span class="s_class">’s</span> why you <span class="can_class">can</span> take a small child on a 30-minute trip, one that you<span class="ve_class">’ve</span> taken together before, and hear the same question every 5 minutes: <span class="are_class">Are</span> we there yet? When <span class="are_class">are</span> we going to get there? How much longer? Etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Sometimes we <span class="might_class">might</span> think a child <span class="is_class">is</span> being unreasonable or difficult, but the reality <span class="is_class">is</span> that the brain develops and changes over time. Even as adults, our knowledge grows and our perspective changes. How  <span class="does_class">does</span> this happen? If logic builds over time, <span class="can_class">can</span> we keep working on this as we get older? How <span class="does_class">does</span> language affect the way we think? Today, the Jean Piaget Society continues to explore questions like these.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="can_class">can</span> learn about Piaget and developmental psychology for free online or in a library. Likewise, if the name Piaget brings images of fine jewelry to mind, you <span class="can_class">can</span> also learn about it online. Another Piaget <span class="was_class">was</span> born in Switzerland about 20 years before Piaget the educator. That Piaget began making watches in a workshop on his family's farm. Over the years, his business expanded and diamonds and fine metals became part of the process. Today, the name Piaget represents a luxurious brand of jewelry. A necklace like the one in the photo probably costs as much as or more than a decent car. If you<span class="re_class">’re</span> ever on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan or another place with a Piaget shop, you <span class="can_class">can</span> take a look.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Everyone <span class="has_class">has</span> their own ideas of what<span class="s_class">’s</span> beautiful, what<span class="s_class">’s</span> interesting, and what<span class="s_class">’s</span> right. Considering that, <span class="would_class">would</span> you rather learn more about Jean Piaget's ideas of how people learn or Piaget the jeweler's business of how to sell luxury?</p>
