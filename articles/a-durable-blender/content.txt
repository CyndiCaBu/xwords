{This[s] is[x] Rosa's old blender}[t-n](;)[j] {she[s] bought[vxd] it in the early 1960s}[t-p]. {Although she used to use it a lot}[f-ct], {she[s] (hasn't)[x] used[dtn] it much lately}[t-b]. {That[s]('s)[x] why she recently decided (to give)[inf] it to her daughter}[t-p], {who would[x] use it much more}[extra].

{When she[s] first got[vxd] this blender}[f-t], {Rosa[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it}[t-p]. {She[s] used[vxd] (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats}[t-p], {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda}[extra]. {(Most people she knew)[s] (didn't)[x] make[v] smoothies in those days}[t-p]. However[l], {when it was[x]really hot outside}[f-t], {Rosa[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade}[t-p]. 

{Soup[s] was[x] another thing she used the blender for}[t-p]. {She[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht,}[t-p] {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables.}[extra] {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name}[t-p], {vichyssoise}[extra]. {(To make)[inf] it}[f-r], {Rosa[s] would[x] cook[v] potatoes and leeks in chicken stock}[t-p]. {After letting it cool off,}[f-t] {she[s] pureed[vxd] it in the blender and then transferred[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream until it reached the right consistency}[t=]. {She[s] said[vxd] that nowadays she would[x] probably use a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot}[t-p]. {Back in the 1960s}[f-t], {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender}[t-p]. {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure you[s] could[x] buy[v] one at that time}[t-p].

{After living in Ecuador for a couple years}[f-t], {Rosa[s] used[vxd] the blender (to mix)[inf] frozen fruit drinks}[t-p]. {(One of her favorites)[s] is[x] mora}[t-n], {a type of blackberry that grows in Ecuador, Colombia and other places}[extra]. {You[s] can[x] see[v] juice made from it}[t-n] {in the image here}[e-p].

{Could[x] a blender made more recently last[v] as long as this one}[t-n-nq]? {Time[s] will[x] tell[v]}[t-n].
