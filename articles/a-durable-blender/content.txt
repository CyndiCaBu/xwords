{This[s] is[x] Rosa's old blender;}[t-n] {she[s] bought[vxd] it in the early 1960s.}[t-p] {Although she used to use it a lot,}[f-ct] {she[s] (hasn't)[x] used[dtn] it much lately.}[t-b] {That[s]('s)[x] why she recently decided (to give)[inf] it to her daughter,}[t-p] {who would[x] use it much more.}[extra]

{When she[s] first got[vxd] this blender,}[f-t] {Rosa[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it.}[t-p] {She[s] used[vxd] (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats,}[t-p] {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda.}[extra] {(Most people she knew)[s] (didn't)[x] make[v] smoothies in those days,}[t-p] {but}[j] {when it was[x]really hot outside,}[f-t] {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade.}[t-p] 

{Soup[s] was[x] another thing Rosa used (to make)[inf] in the blender.}[t-p] {She[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht,}[t-p] {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables.}[extra] {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name,}[t-p] {vichyssoise.}[extra] {(To make)[inf] that,}[f-r] {Rosa[s] would[x] cook[v] the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock.}[t-p] {After letting that cool off,}[f-t] {she[s] pureed[vxd] it in the blender and then transferred[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream until it reached the right consistency.}[t=] {She[s] said[vxd] that nowadays she would[x] probably use a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot,}[t-p] {but}[j] {back in the 1960s,}[f-t] {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender.}[t-p] {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure you[s] could[x] buy[v] one at that time.}[t-p]

{After living in Ecuador for a couple years,}[f-t] {Rosa[s] used[vxd] the blender (to mix)[inf] frozen fruit drinks.}[t-p] {(One of her favorites)[s] is[x] mora,}[t-n] {a type of blackberry that grows in Ecuador, Colombia and other places.}[extra] {You[s] can[x] see[v] juice made from it}[t-n] {in the image here.}[e-p]

{Do[x] you[s] think[v] a blender that was[x] made[dtn] more recently could[x] last[v] as long as this one?}[t-n-nq] {Time[s] will[x] tell[v].}[t-n]
