This[s] is my friend's old blender; she[s] bought it in the early 1960s. That[s] means she has had it for around 50 years, although she[s] hasn't used it much lately. In fact, she recently decided that it would be better to give it to her daughter, who would use it much more.
When she[s] first got this blender, my friend[s] made drinks and baby food in it. She[s] used to make milkshakes and ice cream floats, especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda. She[s] told me that people didn't have smoothies in those days, but when it[s] was really hot outside, she[s] would crush ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade. She[s] also pureed fruit for her kids when they[s] were very young.

Although soup[s] might sound like a strange dish for hot weather, my friend[s] said she used to make at least 2 kinds of soup in the blender, too. One[s] was a deeply colored version of borscht, which is made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables. Another favorite[s] was a cold potato and leek soup that is known by its French name, vichyssoise. My friend[s] explained that when she made that, she[s] would cook the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock and then let it cool. When it[s] wasnâ€™t too hot, she[s] pureed it in the blender and then transferred it to a bowl to add cream until it reached the right consistency. She[s] said that nowadays she would probably use a hand-held immersion blender to puree soup right in the pot, but back in the 1960s she[s] didn't know anyone with that kind of blender. She[s] wasn't even sure if you[s] could buy one at that time.

Years later, after my friend[s] had lived in Ecuador for a couple years, she[s] used the blender to mix frozen fruit drinks. One of her favorites[s] is mora, a type of blackberry. You[s] can see juice made from it in the image here. 

Do you[s] think a blender that was made more recently could last as long as this one? Time will tell.
