{This[s] is[x] my friend's old blender;}[t] {she[s] bought[vxd] it in the early 1960s.}[t] {That[s] means[vxs] she[s] has[x] had[v] it for around 50 years,}[t] {although she[s] (hasn't)[x] used[v] it much lately.}[e] {In fact,}[l] {she[s] recently decided[vxd] that it[s] would[x] be[v] better (to give)[inf] it to her daughter,}[t] {who would[x] use[v] it much more.}[extra]
{When she[s] first got[vxd] this blender,}[f] {my friend[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it.}[t] {She[s] used[vxd] (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats,}[t] {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda.}[extra] {She[s] told[vxd] me that people[s] (didn't)[x] have[v] smoothies in those days,}[t] {but}[j] {when it[s] was[x]really hot outside,}[f] {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade.}[t] 

{Soup[s] was[x] another thing my friend used (to make)[inf] in the blender.}[t] {She[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht,}[t] {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables.}[extra] {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name,}[t] {vichyssoise.}[extra] {(To make)[inf] that,}[f] {(my friend)[s] would[x] cook[v] the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock.}[t] {After letting it cool off,}[f] {she[s] pureed[vxd] it in the blender and then transferred[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream until it reached the right consistency.}[t] {She[s] said[vxd] that nowadays she[s] would[x] probably use[v] a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot,}[t] {but}[j] {back in the 1960s,}[f] {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender.}[t] {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure if you[s] could[x] buy[v] one at that time.}[t]

{Years later,}[l] {after (my friend)[s] had[x] lived[dtn] in Ecuador for a couple years,}[f] {she[s] used[vxd] the blender (to mix)[inf] frozen fruit drinks.}[t] {(One of her favorites)[s] is[x] mora,}[t] {a type of blackberry.}[extra] {You[s] can[x] see[v] juice made from it}[t] {in the image here.}[e]
