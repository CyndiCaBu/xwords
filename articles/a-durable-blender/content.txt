{When she[s] first got[vxd] this blender,}[f-t] {Rosa[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it.}[t] {She[s] used[vxd] (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats,}[t] {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda.}[extra] {(Most people she knew)[s] (didn't)[x] make[v] smoothies in those days,}[t] {but}[j] {when it was[x]really hot outside,}[f-t] {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade.}[t] 

{Soup[s] was[x] another thing Rosa used (to make)[inf] in the blender.}[t] {She[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht,}[t] {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables.}[extra] {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name,}[t] {vichyssoise.}[extra] {(To make)[inf] that,}[f-r] {Rosa[s] would[x] cook[v] the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock.}[t] {After letting that cool off,}[f-t] {she[s] pureed[vxd] it in the blender and then transferred[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream until it reached the right consistency.}[t] {She[s] said[vxd] that nowadays she[s] would[x] probably use[v] a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot,}[t] {but}[j] {back in the 1960s,}[f-t] {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender.}[t] {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure you[s] could[x] buy[v] one at that time.}[t]
