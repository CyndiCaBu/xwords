{Debbie[s] bought[vxd] this blender}[t-p] {in the early 1960s}[e-t], {shortly after getting[ger] married}[extra]. {When her kids were[x] little}[f-t], {she[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it}[t-p]. {Although she (didn't)[x] keep[v] soda in the house or let the kids drink it often}[f-ct], {she[s] also made[vxd] special treats in the blender}[t-p]. {The kids[s] loved[vxd] (to mix)[inf] vanilla ice cream with raspberry soda for ice cream floats}[t-p], {a sugar overload that Debbie (wouldn't)[x] dream of drinking[ger] now}[extra]. 

{When it was[x] really hot outside}[f-t], {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade}[t-p]. {She[s] had[vxd] a few favorite soup recipes that required blending[ger]}[t-p], {too}[extra]. {(She and her family)[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht}[t-p], {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables}[extra]. {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name}[t-p], vichyssoise[extra]. First[l] {she[s] would[x] cook[v] potatoes and leeks in chicken stock}[t-p]. {After letting[ger] that cool off}[f-t], {she[s] would[x] puree[v] it in the blender and then transfer[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream}[t-p]. {She[s] said[vxd] that today she would[x] probably use a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot}[t-p]. {Back in the 1960s and 70s}[f-t], {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender}[t-p]. {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure a home cook could[x] find[v] one (to buy)[inf] at that time}[t-p].

{Debbie[s] (doesn't)[x] use[v] her blender much now}[t-n-nq], but[j] {it[s] still works[vxs] well}[t-n] - {after more than half a century}[extra]. {Could[x] a blender made more recently last[v] as long as that}[t-n-nq]?
