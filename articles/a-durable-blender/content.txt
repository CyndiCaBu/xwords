{This[s] is[x] Debbie's old blender}[t-n]. {She[s] bought[vxd] it}[t-p] {in the early 1960s}[e-t], {shortly after getting married}[extra]. {When her kids were[x] little}[f-t], {she[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it}[t-p]. {She[s] also used[vxd] it (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats}[t-p], {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda}[extra]. {That[s] was[x] a special treat}[t-p](;)[j] {she[s] (didn't)[x] keep[v] soda in the house or let the kids drink it often}[t-p-nq]. {When it was[x] really hot outside}[f-t], {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade}[t-p]. 

{Debbie[s] also had[vxd] a few favorite soup recipes that required blending}[t-p]. {(She and her family)[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht}[t-p], {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables}[extra]. {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name}[t-p], vichyssoise[extra]. First[l] {she[s] would[x] cook[v] potatoes and leeks in chicken stock}[t-p].{After letting that cool off}[f-t], {she[s] would[x] puree[v] it in the blender and then transfer[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream}[t-p]. {She[s] said[vxd] that today she would[x] probably use a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot}[t-p]. {Back in the 1960s and 70s}[f-t], {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender}[t-p]. {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure a home cook could[x] find[v] one (to buy)[inf] at that time}[t-p].

{After living in Ecuador for a couple years}[f-t], {Debbie[s] used[vxd] the blender (to mix)[inf] frozen fruit drinks}[t-p], {like the kind she('d)[x] had there}[extra]. {(One of her favorites)[s] is[x] mora[em]}[t-n], {a type of blackberry that grows in Ecuador, Colombia and other places}[extra]. {You[s] can[x] see[v] juice made from it}[t-n] {in the image here}[e-p].

{Debbie[s] (doesn't)[x] use[v] her blender much now}[t-n-nq], but[j] {it[s] still works[vxs] well}[t-n] - {after more than half a century}[extra]. {Could[x] a blender made more recently last[v] as long as that}[t-n-nq]? {Time[s] will[x] tell[v]}[t-n].
