{This[s] is[x] Rosa's old blender;}[t] {she[s] bought[vxd] it in the early 1960s.}[t] {Although she used to use it a lot,}[f] {she[s] (hasn't)[x] used[dtn] it much lately.}[t] {That[s]('s)[x] why she recently decided (to give)[inf] it to her daughter,}[t] {who would[x] use it much more.}[extra]

{When she[s] first got[vxd] this blender,}[f] {Rosa[s] made[vxd] drinks and baby food in it.}[t] {She[s] used[vxd] (to make)[inf] milkshakes and ice cream floats,}[t] {especially with vanilla ice cream and raspberry soda.}[extra] {(Most people she knew)[s] (didn't)[x] make[v] smoothies in those days,}[t] {but}[j] {when it was[x]really hot outside,}[f] {she[s] would[x] crush[v] ice in the blender for cold drinks like iced tea and lemonade.}[t] 

{Soup[s] was[x] another thing Rosa used (to make)[inf] in the blender.}[t] {She[s] liked[vxd] the deep colors of borscht,}[t] {a soup made with beets, cabbage and other vegetables.}[extra] {(Another favorite)[s] was[x] a cold potato and leek soup often known by its French name,}[t] {vichyssoise.}[extra] {(To make)[inf] that,}[f] {Rosa[s] would[x] cook[v] the potatoes and leeks in chicken stock.}[t] {After letting that cool off,}[f] {she[s] pureed[vxd] it in the blender and then transferred[vxd] it to a bowl (to add)[inf] cream until it reached the right consistency.}[t] {She[s] said[vxd] that nowadays she[s] would[x] probably use[v] a hand-held immersion blender(to puree)[inf] soup right in the pot,}[t] {but}[j] {back in the 1960s,}[f] {she[s] (didn't)[x] know[v] anyone with that kind of blender.}[t] {She[s] (wasn't)[x] even sure if you[s] could[x] buy[v] one at that time.}[t]

{Years later,}[l] {after (Rosa)[s] had[x] lived[dtn] in Ecuador for a couple years,}[f] {she[s] used[vxd] the blender (to mix)[inf] frozen fruit drinks.}[t] {(One of her favorites)[s] is[x] mora,}[t] {a type of blackberry that grows in Ecuador, Colombia and other places.}[extra] {You[s] can[x] see[v] juice made from it}[t] {in the image here.}[e]
