{Which would[x] scare[v] you more at the beach}[t-n-nq]: {feeling the water pull you out towards the deeper parts, like a magnet that you (can’t)[x] resist[v]}[extra]? {Or getting knocked over by a big wave, so that you(’re)[x] suddenly underwater and not sure which way is[x] up}[extra]? 

{(Both of those situations)[s] could[x] be[v] dangerous,}[t-n] {especially if you (don’t)[x] know[v] how (to swim)[inf] or you(’re)[x] not comfortable in the water}[extra]. {Since you can[x] see[v] big waves easily}[f-r], {they[s] might[x] be[v] easier (to avoid)[inf]}[t-n]. {(Those invisible magnets pulling you far from shore)[s] can[x] be[v] trickier}[t-n]. {They[s](’re)[x] not actually magnets}[t-n], {of course}[extra]. {They[s](’re)[x] called[v] rip currents}[t-n].

{(Rip currents)[s] are[x] strong, narrow flows of water that extend away from the shore}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] happen[v] at any beach with breaking waves}[t-n], {not just at the ocean}[t-n]. {(One type of rip current)[s] looks[vxs] like flat, smooth water between the breaking waves}[t-n]. {It[s] might[x] even seem[v] like a safe place (to swim)[inf]}[t-n], {away from the waves}[extra].  However[l], {(that flat part of the water)[s] could[x] be[v] a fast, one-way trip out to the deeper water}[t-n] - {on a rip current}[extra]. 

{According to Greg Dusek}[l],  {a scientist who studies the ocean and its currents}[extra], {(rip currents)[s] can[x] last[v] for minutes}[t-n] - {or months}[extra]. {They[s] range[vxo] from 15 to 100 meters wide}[t-n], and[j] {they[s] can[x] take[v] you 100 to 400 meters offshore}[t-n]. {Although they (don’t)[x] pull[v] you under the water}[f-ct], {they[s] do[x] pull[v] you out}[t-n]. How far? {It[s] depends[vxs] on your knowledge and your ability (to stay)[inf] calm and either swim[v] or float[v]}[t-n]. 

#Swim parallel to shore.

{You[s] can[x] get[v] out of a rip current by turning[ger] to the side and swimming[ger] parallel to the shore}[t-n]. {Focus[v] on the facts}[t-n-nq]: {(the rip current)[s] will[x] not pull[v] you under the water}[t-n]. {You[s] need[vxo] (to escape)[inf] its pull}[t-n], and[j] {you[s] can[x]}[t-n]. {Panicking[s] (won't)[x] help[v]}[t-n]. {(Going to the side of the current)[s] will[x]}[t-n].  

{It[s] (doesn’t)[x] matter[v] if you need (to swim)[inf] far down the shore}[t-n], {away from where you started}[extra].  {(Getting out of the rip current)[s] is[x] what matters}[t-n]. {Swim[v] off to the side}[t-n-nq], {at an angle}[extra]. {When you (don’t)[x] feel[v] the water pulling you out anymore}[f-t], {you[s] can[x] start[v] heading towards the shore}[t-n]. {It('s)[x] much easier (to walk)[inf] back to your starting point on land}[t-n], {where you can[x] breathe[v] more easily}[extra].

{So what if you get stuck in a rip current and you (can’t)[x] swim[v]}[t-n-nq]? OK. {You[s] can[x] float[v], wave[v] your arms and call[v] for help}[t-n]. {Even if the water is[x] pulling[v] you out}[f-cd], {keep[v] floating}[t-n-nq]. {Focus[v] on keeping your head above water}[t-n]. {Look[v] for a place where the waves are[x] breaking[v]}[t-n-nq]. {That[s] might[x] be[v] a sandbar}[t-n-nq], {hopefully where the water is[x] shallow enough for you (to stand)[inf] up}[extra]. {That[s] will[x] give[v] you a chance (to catch)[inf] your breath and shout[v] for help again}[t-n]. {If you see a place where water is[x] flowing[v] onto the beach instead of away from the beach}[f-cd], {try[v] (to get)[inf] there}[t-n]. {(That water)[s] can[x] save[v] you by carrying you safely to shore}[t-n].  

{What if you are[x] on the beach and you see another person caught in a rip current}[t-n-nq]? {You[s] should[x] yell[v] for a lifeguard and throw[v] the person something that can[x] float[v]}[t-n]. {(Don’t)[x] try[v] (to rescue)[inf] the person yourself}[t-n-nq]; {you[s] (don’t)[x] have[v] a good chance of succeeding}[t-n]. {(Chances of drowning)[s] are[x] higher}[t-n]. {When lifeguards go into the water to rescue someone}[f-t], {they[s] always take[vxo] a flotation device with them}[t-n]. {As experts in water rescue}[extra], {they[s] know[vxo] the risks}[t-n].

#Know Before You Go.

{(Rip currents)[s] can[x] happen[v] anywhere with breaking waves}[t-n]. {In fact}[l], {they[s] are[x] caused[v] by breaking waves}[t-n], {even if (those waves)[s] (aren’t)[x] very big}[extra]. {(Hard structures like a jetty, pier, or rocky outcrop)[s] focus[vxo] the wave energy}[t-n]. {As a result}[l], {they[s] can[x] have[v] rip currents almost all the time}[t-n]. {At low tide}[f-t], {when (the water)[s] may[x] seem[v] calm}[f-t], {(rip currents)[s] are[x] strongest}[t-n].

{(Dr. Dusek and others)[s] recommend[vxo] spending some time observing the water before going close to it}[t-n]. {Stand[v] back}[t-n-nq], {up higher if you can[x]}[extra], and[j] {look[v] at the water surface clearly}[t-n-nq]. {If you see foam and different colors of water with sand and sediment}[f-cd], {you[s] are[x] probably looking[v] at a rip current}[t-n]. {If you notice a flat, calm-looking section of water between breaking waves}[f-cd], {(don't)[x] let[v] it fool you}[t-n-nq]. {It[s](’s)[x] a channel of flowing water}[t-n], {flowing fast and out, away from the shore}[extra] - {a rip current}[extra]. 

#If in doubt, (don’t)[x] go[v] out.

{(The easiest way (to avoid)[inf] getting caught in a rip current)[s] is[x] (to stay)[inf] out of the water}[t-n]. {(Another way)[s] is[x] (to make)[inf] sure you always go in the water near a lifeguard}[t-n]. {They will[x] warn[v] you about dangerous water conditions}[t-n], and[j] {they[s] can[x] rescue[v] you}[t-n] {if needed}[e-cd]. {Knowing how (to recognize)[inf] and escape[v] rip currents is[x] crucial}[t-n].

{If you (don’t)[x] like[v] the water but you have[x] friends who do[x]}[f-cd], {please share this information with them}[t-n-nq]. {Ask[v] them what they know about rip currents}[t-n-nq]. {See[v] if they have[x] any good stories about sandbars}[t-n-nq]. {Find[v] out if they always swim near lifeguards and if not}[t-n-nq], {why not}[extra]. {We[s] might[x] think[v] we are[x] strong and competent}[t-n], but[j] {water[s] can[x] be[v] full of surprises}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] better (to respect)[inf] its power from the beginning}[t-n].
