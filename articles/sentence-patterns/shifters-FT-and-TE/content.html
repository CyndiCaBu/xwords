<p>Shifters can shift. In other words, they can move. They're the part of a sentence that connects to a trunk, to add some important information. The trunk is solid, with its SVO, but the shifter can move, like leaves in the wind. The meaning doesn't change.</p>

<p>What's the difference between these 2 sentences?
<em>More than 100 million years ago, dinosaurs were different.</em>


<em>Dinosaurs were different more than 100 million years ago.</em>

Both sentences have the same meaning; they just follow 2 different patterns. The time information ("more than 100 million years ago") can go in the front or at the end. That's why it's called a shifter (because it can move around).

If that information is in the front of the sentence, it's a <strong>front shifter</strong> (F,T):

<em>More than 100 million years ago, dinosaurs were different.</em>

If we move that information to the end of the sentence, it's an <strong>end shifter</strong> (TE):

<em>Dinosaurs were different more than 100 million years ago.</em>

(You don't need a comma before the end shifter.)

Time shifters like "100 million years ago" are common. There are other types of shifters, too.

<p></p>Check your writing for shifter words. Make sure you connect them to a trunk. If you don't, you will make a common mistake, often called a fragment (a piece of a sentence, missing the trunk). Consider these 3 examples:</p>
Although it might look scary, this dinosaur is just a puppet. <strong>(F,T)</strong>

Although it might look scary. <strong>(fragment)</strong>

This dinosaur is just a puppet although it might look scary. <strong>(TE)</strong>

Which one sounds incomplete? In conversation, as an answer to a question, the 2nd sentence is fine. However, in writing, it's not a complete sentence all by itself. Even though it has a trunk inside it (<em>it might look scary</em>), the word <em>although</em> makes it a shifter, so it has to be connected to a trunk. The same is true in these sentences:

If you go to Field Station Dinosaurs, you can see this puppet in person.

You can see this puppet in person if you go to Field Station Dinosaurs.</p>
