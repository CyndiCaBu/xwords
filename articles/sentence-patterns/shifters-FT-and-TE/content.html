<p>Shifters can shift. In other words, they can move. They're the part of a sentence that connects to a trunk, to add some important information. The trunk is solid, with its SVO, but the shifter can move, like leaves in the wind. The meaning doesn't change.</p>

<p>What's the difference between these 2 sentences?
<em>More than 100 million years ago, dinosaurs were different.</em>


<em>Dinosaurs were different more than 100 million years ago.</em>

Both sentences have the same meaning; they just follow 2 different patterns. The time information ("more than 100 million years ago") can go in the front or at the end. That's why it's called a shifter (because it can move around).

If that information is in the front of the sentence, it's a <strong>front shifter</strong> (F,T):

<em>More than 100 million years ago, dinosaurs were different.</em>

If we move that information to the end of the sentence, it's an <strong>end shifter</strong> (TE):

<em>Dinosaurs were different more than 100 million years ago.</em>

(You don't need a comma before the end shifter.)

Time shifters like "100 million years ago" are common. There are other types of shifters, too.

Check your writing for shifter words. Make sure you connect them to a trunk. If you don't, you will make a common mistake, often called a fragment (a piece of a sentence, missing the trunk). Consider these 3 examples:</p>
