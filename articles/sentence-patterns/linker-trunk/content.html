</p>A linker is a word or phrase that connects the ideas between 1 sentence and the next. (Link means connect.) Linkers usually go at the beginning of a sentence, so they start with a captial letter. Put a comma after the linker. This pattern is called <strong>Linker, Trunk</strong> (L,T). 

Many linkers mean the same thing as some of the common joiner words (<em>and, but, so, etc.</em>). The difference is in their position in a sentence. Linkers go at the beginning, before the trunk. Joiners go in the middle, between 2 trunks. 

Here are some common linkers, organized by their meaning:

<em>Note</em>: Remember the comma and limit your writing to 1 linker per short paragraph, like this:<br></br>Digitalis is the scientific name for a plant commonly known as foxglove. The flowers look like little trumpets, with the pollen deep inside. They grow in clusters on a long, green stalk. Although the digitalis plant itself is only a biennial, lasting for 2 years, it can reproduce. <strong>As a result</strong>, it can be somewhat invasive, and some gardeners might even consider it a weed.<p>
