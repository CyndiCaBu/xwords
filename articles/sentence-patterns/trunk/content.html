<p>The most basic sentence pattern is <strong>Subject + Verb</strong> (SV): Trees grow.

We usually add more information with <strong>Subject + Verb + Object</strong> (SVO): We need them.

In x-word grammar, we call SVO a <strong>trunk</strong>. It's the foundation of every sentence, like the strong, solid part of a tree.

With a strong trunk, a tree can grow branches and leaves. It's the same for a sentence. Without a trunk, something is missing.

How can you decide if your sentence has at least a trunk? Every trunk will turn into a Yes/No question, starting with an x-word.</p>

<p>Trees grow. <em>(Do trees grow?)</em>

We need them. <em>(Do we need them?)</em>

They give us oxygen. <em>(Do they give us oxygen?)</em>

They also absorb carbon dioxide. <em>(Do they absorb carbon dioxide?)</em>

How do these sentences sound if we put them all together in a paragraph?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees grow. We need them. They give us oxygen. They also absorb carbon dioxide.

Hmm. Too basic? Let's combine these trunks and add 1 word:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees grow. We need them because they give us oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide.

Now we have 2 trunks instead of 4, with the extra word "because." Which version do you like better? Why? Click the other sentence patterns to learn more! </p>
