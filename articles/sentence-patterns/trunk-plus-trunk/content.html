<p>A trunk is a complete sentence, because it has SVO. Notice the period at the end!

One way to add more information to the same sentence is by adding another trunk. 

The result is a longer complete sentence made of SVO + SVO, which we call Trunk + Trunk or <strong>T, + T.</strong> 

<em>Note</em>: If you have trouble with run-on sentences, your solution starts here. In SVO + SVO, you <strong> must </strong> fill the <strong>+</strong> position with one of these joiners (connector words), <strong>NOT a comma</strong>:

<strong>and
but
so
or
; </strong>(pronounced semi-colon; used instead of <strong>and</strong>)
<strong>for</strong> (meaning <strong>because</strong>)
<strong>yet</strong> (meaning <strong>but</strong>)
<strong>NOT just a comma!</strong> (comma before the joiner)</p>

<em>Examples:</em>

These two trees are different, <strong>but</strong> they grew so close they almost look connected.

The one on the left is probably a white birch<strong>;</strong> you can tell by its color and the peeling bark.</p>
