{(Positive psychology)[s] is[x] for people who are[x] already healthy}[t-n], {in a psychological sense}[extra]. {It[s] helps[v] us increase our well-being by focusing on our character strengths}[t-n] - {and those of others}[extra]. {(Strengths like kindness, curiosity and hope)[s] support[v] each element of positive psychology}[t-n]. {(These elements)[s] all contribute[v] to our well-being}[t-n]. 

{(The acronym PERMAH)[s] can[x] help[v] us remember the 6 elements of positive psychology}[t-n]. {(Their connection to character strengths)[s] is[x] described[v] below}[t-n].

# P for Positive Emotions

{We[s] can[x] use[v] our strengths (to pay)[inf] more attention to positive emotions than negative}[t-n]. {For example}[l], {it[s]('s)[x] easier for us (to find)[inf] amusing moments throughout the day}[t-n] {if humor is[x] one of our strengths}[e-cd]. Likewise[l], {we[s] might[x] experience[v] more serenity with the strengths of spirituality, self-control and forgiveness}[t-n].

# E for Engagement

{In positive psychology}[f-p], {engagement[s] means[v] being awake, active and involved in our own lives}[t-n]. {It[s] means[v] using our strengths (to live)[inf] with energy and purpose}[t-n]. {We[s] (don't)[x] just let[v] the days go by without trying (to make)[inf] them go better}[t-n]. 

# R for Positive Relationships

{(Our strengths)[s] help[v] us build and nourish positive relationships with others}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] use[v] our strengths (to interact)[inf] with respect and affection}[t-n], {focusing on others' strengths instead of their flaws}[extra].  

# M and A for Meaning and Achievement

{When we know our own strengths}[f-t], {we[s] can[x] use[v] them (to give)[inf] our lives meaning}[t-n]. {What do[x] we[s] really want[v] (to do)[inf] in the time we have}[t-n-nq]? {Who do[x] we[s] want[v] (to serve)[inf]}[t-n-nq], {and how}[extra]? {(Our strengths)[s] increase[v] our chances of accomplishing the goals we set for ourselves}[t-n]. {Whether we measure our accomplishments in small, personal ways or large, more general ones}[f-cd], {(our strengths)[s] matter[v]}[t-n]. 

# H for Health and Vitality

{Although we (don't)[x] need[v] (to be)[inf] in excellent health (to flourish)[inf]}[f-ct], {health[s] is[x] part of well-being}[t-n]. {(Our strengths)[s] can[x] encourage[v] us (to make)[inf] decisions that support our vitality}[t-n]. {Moderation[s], (for instance)[extra], can[x] help[v] us limit how salty our food is[x] or how much time we spend looking at screens before going (to sleep)[inf]}[t-n]. {Teamwork[s] can[x] be[v] part of ways we get exercise in the form of dance, sports or other activities}[t-n].

# Focus on Strengths

{(Character strengths)[s] are[x] different from physical strength}[t-n]. {They[s]('re)[x] about how we think and how we act}[t-n]. {(A survey on the VIA Character website)[s] can[x] help[v] us consider which strengths we identify with the most}[t-n], but[j] {it[s]('s)[x] up to us (to find)[inf] new ways (to use)[inf] them}[t-n]. {The more we learn about character strengths, the more we can[x] use our own and see how others use theirs}[t-n-nq]. {(The goal)[s] is[x] (to flourish)[inf]}[t-n].
