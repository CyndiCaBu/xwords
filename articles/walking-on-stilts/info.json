	"description": "Have you ever stood next to someone walking on stilts or tried to do it yourself? It might look fun, but it's not easy. You need to balance carefully and take your first steps with confidence - yet not too fast. You canâ€™t be afraid to take a risk. It helps to have someone show you how to get off the stilts quickly in case you feel like you're going to fall.",
