Have you ever stood next to someone walking on stilts? Better yet, have you ever tried to walk on stilts yourself? It might look fun, but it probably doesn’t look easy. You need to balance carefully and you can’t be afraid to take a risk, because when you take your first steps walking on stilts, you know there’s a chance you could fall.
Why do people walk on stilts, anyway? If you’ve  ever seen stilt walkers at a parade or a festival, you can probably think of a few  different answers. Consider the perspective of someone looking down on everyone and everything else from several feet higher. Look at everyone in the picture here, which was taken at the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn. The people walking on the ground only come up to the feet of most of the stilt walkers. They could look into the windows of the huge truck, but the stilt walkers can see right over the top of it. Their height gives them an advantage; it commands respect and shows power.
What do you think about the styles and postures of the different stilt walkers in this particular photo?  The one in the center looks young and not nearly as strong as the muscular man behind him, but the stilts still give him some authority. The guy on the far right photographer is smiling, while the one on the far left looks like he’s  trying to scare or tease the crowd. Some of the stilt walkers are coming towards the photographer, filmmaker Naheem Adio, while others are walking the other way. Imagine being right there with them. What do you think happened next?
