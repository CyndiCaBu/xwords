{One November}[f-t], {we[s] went[vxd] to Herald Square in Manhattan}[t-p] {(to watch)[inf] the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade}[e-r]. {We[s] were[x] expecting[v] (to see)[inf] crowds of people and a parade with huge balloons}[t-p]. {We[s] did[x] see[v] all that}[t-p], but[j] {we[s] also saw[vxd] much more}[t-p]. {While I was[x] trying (to take)[inf] pictures through the crowd}[f-t], {I[s] heard[vxd] some beautiful music playing nearby}[t-p]. {I[s] turned[vxd] around}[t-p], {looking for a saxophone or some other type of horn made of metal}[extra]. {I[s] was[x] surprised (to find)[inf] a man playing a horn he had[x] made out of PVC pipe}[t-p]. {He[s] explained[vxd] that he had[x] put a reed in it}[t-p], {the kind that comes from a music shop}[extra]. {Other than that}[l], {(the materials he used)[s] were[x] from a hardware store or plumbing supply shop}[t-p]. {He[s] gave[vxo] me his business card and introduced[vxo] himself as Abu the Flutemaker}[t=p].

Later[l]m {when I searched for information about him}[f-t], {I[s] learned[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] always go by the name Abu}[t-p-nq]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] know about his musical talent for a long time either}[t-p-nq]. {In one video}[l], {he[s] explains[vxs] that someone once left a flute in his house}[t-p]. {He[s] just started[vxd] playing it}[t]. (At first)[l] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] any sound out of it}[t-p-nq], but[j] {he[s] (didn’t)[x] give[v] up}[t-p-nq]. {When he tried one last time}[f-t], {he[s] discovered[vxd] something he had[x] never known}[t-p]: {he[s] has[vxs] perfect pitch}[extra]. {(That discovery)[s] changed[vxd] his life}[t-p].

{Excited about music}[extra], {Abu[s] quit[vxd] his job and began[vxd] dedicating himself to making and playing instruments}[t=p]. {He[s] often used[vxd] found objects}[t-p], {the things that other people (don’t)[x] want and leave in the trash, on the streets, etc}[extra]. {In one video}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] see[v] a marimba with wrenches for keys and a guitar made out of an old clock}[t-n]. {He[s] began[vxd] making all kinds of instruments and playing familiar jazz tunes and more}[t-p].

{Abu[s] decided[vxd] (to share)[inf] his talent with kids in Baltimore}[t-p], (where he lives)[extra]. {He[s] wanted[vxd] (to work)[inf] in recreation centers (to teach)[inf] kids how (to make)[inf] drums and flutes}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] a job}[t]. {Knowing that sometimes people (don’t)[x] appreciate what(’s)[x] right in front of them}[extra], {he[s] decided[vxd] (to lie)[inf]}[t-p]. {Although he had[x] never been to Africa}[f-ct], {he[s] started[vxd] wearing African clothes and saying he was[x] African}[t-p]. {(His trick)[s] worked[vxd]}[t](;)[j] {he[s] got[vxd] hired}[t-p]. {He[s] even played[vxd] music on TV}[t-p]. 

{Eventually}[l], {Abu[s] decided[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] want (to lie)[inf] anymore}[t-p]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] want (to give)[inf] younger people the wrong message}[t-p-nq].   {"You[s](don't)[x] need[v] (to be)[inf] from (Somewhere Else)[em] (to be)[inf] creative,"}[t-n-nq] {he explained}[extra]. {He[s] wanted[vxd] people (to know)[inf] they could[x] be[v] special}[t-p] {even if the place they lived felt ordinary}[e-cd].

{When one of the videos was[x] made}[f-t], {Abu[s] was[x] 71 years old}[t-p]. {He[s] said[vxd] that he doesn’t want (to leave)[inf] this world behind without sharing all his knowledge of how (to make)[inf] instruments}[t-p-nq]. Maybe[l] {(that)[s](’s)[x]  one of the reasons that he went all the way from Baltimore to New York for Thanksgiving}[t-p] {(to keep)[inf] spreading his talent around}[extra]. {I[s](’m)[x] thankful that he did[x]}[t-p].
