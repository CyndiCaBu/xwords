{One November,}[f] {we[s] went[vxd] to Herald Square in Manhattan}[t] {(to watch)[inf] the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade.}[e] {We[s] were[x] expecting[v] (to see)[inf] crowds of people and a parade with huge balloons.}[t] {We[s] did[x] see[v] all that}[t]{,of course,}[extra] but[j] {we[s] also saw[vxd] much more.}[t] {While I was[x] trying (to take)[inf] pictures through the crowd,}[f] {I[s] heard[vxd] some beautiful music playing nearby.}[t] {I[s] turned[vxd] around}[t], {looking for a saxophone or some other type of horn made of metal.}[extra] {Imagine[v] how surprised I was[x]}[t] {when I found a man playing a horn he had[x] made out of PVC pipe.}[e] {He[s] told[vxd] me that he had[x] put a reed in it,}[t] {the kind that comes from a music shop.}[extra] {(The rest of the materials he used)[s] were[x] from a hardware store or plumbing supply shop.}[t] {He[s] gave[vxo] me his business card and introduced[vxo] himself as Abu the Flutemaker.}[t]

(Later,)[l] {when I searched for information about him,}[f] {I[s] learned[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] always go by the name Abu.}[t] {He[s] (didn’t)[x] know about his musical talent for a long time,}[t] (either.)[extra] {In one video,}[l] {he[s] explains[vxs] that someone once left a flute in his house.}[t] {He[s] just started[vxd] playing it.}[t] (At first)[l] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] any sound out of it,}[t] but[j] {he[s] (didn’t)[x] give[v] up.}[t] {When he tried one last time,}[f] {he[s] discovered[vxd] something he had[x] never known}[t](: he has[vxs] perfect pitch.)[extra] {(That discovery)[s] changed[vxd] his life.}[t]

 	{Abu[s] decided[vxd] (to share)[inf] his talent with kids in Baltimore,}[t] (where he lives.)[extra] {He[s] wanted[vxd] (to work)[inf] in recreation centers (to teach)[inf] kids how (to make)[inf] drums and flutes,}[t] but[j] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] a job.}[t] (Knowing that sometimes people (don’t)[x] appreciate what’s right in front of them,)[extra] he[s] decided[vxd] (to lie)[inf]. (Although he had[x] never been to Africa,)[f] {he[s] started[vxd] wearing African clothes and saying he was[x] African.}[t] {(His trick)[s] worked[vxd];}[t] {he got hired.}[t] {He even played[vxd] music on TV.}[t]
