{One November}[f-t], {we[s] went[vxd] to Herald Square in Manhattan}[t-p] {(to watch)[inf] the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade}[e-r]. {We[s] were[x] expecting[vg] (to see)[inf] crowds of people and a parade with huge balloons}[t-p]. {We[s] did[x] see[v] all that}[t-p], but[j] {we[s] also saw[vxd] much more}[t-p]. {While I was[x] trying[vg] (to take)[inf] pictures through the crowd}[f-t], {I[s] heard[vxd] some beautiful music playing[ger] nearby}[t-p]. {I[s] turned[vxd] around}[t-p], {looking[ger] for a saxophone or some other type of horn made of metal}[extra]. {I[s] was[x] surprised (to find)[inf] a man playing[ger] a horn he had[x] made[dtn] out of PVC pipe}[t-p]. {He[s] explained[vxd] that he had[x] put[dtn] a reed in it}[t-p], {the kind that comes from a music shop}[extra]. {Other than that}[l], {(the materials he used)[s] were[x] from a hardware store or plumbing supply shop}[t-p]. {He[s] gave[vxo] me his business card and introduced[vxo] himself as Abu the Flutemaker}[t=p].

Later[l] {I[s] learned[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] always go[v] by the name Abu}[t-p-nq]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] know[v] about his musical talent for a long time either}[t-p-nq]. {In one video}[l], {he[s] explains[vxs] that someone once left a flute in his house}[t-p]. {He[s] just started[vxd] playing[ger] it}[t-p]. (At first)[l] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] any sound out of it}[t-p-nq], but[j] {he[s] (didn’t)[x] give[v] up}[t-p-nq]. {When he tried one last time}[f-t], {he[s] discovered[vxd] something he had[x] never known[dtn]}[t-p]: {he[s] had[vxd] perfect pitch}[extra]. {(That discovery)[s] changed[vxd] his life}[t-p].

{Excited about music}[extra], {Abu[s] quit[vxd] his job and began[vxd] dedicating[ger] himself to making[ger] and playing[ger] instruments}[t=p]. {He[s] often used[vxd] found objects}[t-p], {the things that other people (don’t)[x] want[v] and leave in the trash, on the streets, etc}[extra]. {In one video}[f-p], {you[s] can[x] see[v] a marimba with wrenches for keys and a guitar made out of an old clock}[t-n]. {He[s] began[vxd] making[ger] all kinds of instruments and playing[ger] familiar jazz tunes and more}[t-p].

{Abu[s] decided[vxd] (to share)[inf] his talent with kids in his own city}[t-p], Baltimore[extra]. {He[s] wanted[vxd] (to work)[inf] in recreation centers (to teach)[inf] kids how (to make)[inf] drums and flutes}[t-p], but[j] {he[s] (couldn’t)[x] get[v] a job}[t]. {Knowing[ger] that sometimes people (don’t)[x] appreciate[v] what(’s)[x] right in front of them}[extra], {he[s] decided[vxd] (to lie)[inf]}[t-p]. {Although he had[x] never been to Africa}[f-ct], {he[s] started[vxd] wearing[ger] traditional African clothes and saying[ger] he was[x] African}[t-p]. {(His trick)[s] worked[vxd]}[t](;)[j] {he[s] got[vxd] hired}[t-p]. {He[s] even played[vxd] music on TV}[t-p]. 

{Eventually}[l], {Abu[s] decided[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to lie)[inf] anymore}[t-p]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to give)[inf] younger people the wrong message}[t-p-nq] - {the idea that you can[x] only be[v] special if you come from far away}[extra]. {"You[s] (don't)[x] need[v] (to be)[inf] from (Somewhere Else)[em] (to be)[inf] creative,"}[t-n-nq] {he explained}[extra].

{In one video}[f-t], {Abu[s] said[vxd] that he (didn’t)[x] want[v] (to leave)[inf] this world behind without sharing[ger] all his knowledge of how (to make)[inf] instruments}[t-p-nq]. Maybe[l] {(that)[s](’s)[x]  one of the reasons that he went all the way from Baltimore to New York for Thanksgiving}[t-p], {(to keep)[inf] spreading[ger] his talent around}[extra]. {I[s](’m)[x] thankful that he did[x]}[t-p].
