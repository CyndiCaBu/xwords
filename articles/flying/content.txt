Are you afraid of heights? There are some people who can’t look over the edge of a cliff or a tall building without feeling a little queasy, but others don’t share that kind of reaction at all. They would love the chance to go paragliding or hang-gliding, to feel the freedom of moving through the air and looking all around at the sky and the mountains, like a bird. Of course, you probably need to be in good shape to do that because you might have to run a little as you land. It depends on the wind, but the idea is to keep moving so that you don’t just crash into the ground.
If you’d rather use resources other than your own energy, you could try a hot air balloon. The landing may still be bumpy, but the flight can last longer. You ride in a basket, and it’s  generally a smooth, quiet flight. Some baskets even have places where you can sit down if you want to.
If you don’t mind burning some type of fuel to get yourself up in the air, you could try parasailing. You start in a motor boat and wear a lifejacket, but you probably won’t get wet. You wear a harness that gets attached to a parachute, and your legs rest on something that looks like a swing. As the boat speeds through the water, you begin to float slowly up in the air. When you come down, someone on the boat helps you land gently, in a standing position.
Do any of these types of flight sound like fun, or would you rather leave flying to birds and insects?
