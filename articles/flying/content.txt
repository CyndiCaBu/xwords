{Are[x] you[s] afraid of heights}[t-n-nq]? {(Some people)[s] (can't)[x] look[v] over the edge of a cliff or a tall building without feeling[ger] a little queasy}[t-n]. {Others[s] (don’t)[x] share[v] that kind of reaction at all}[t-n-nq]. {They[s] would[x] love[v] the chance (to go)[inf] paragliding[ger] or hang-gliding[ger]}[t-n], {(to feel)[inf] the freedom of moving[ger] through the air and looking[ger] all around at the sky and the mountains}[extra], {like a bird}[extra]. {You[s] need[vxo] (to be)[inf] in good shape (to do)[inf] that}[t-n] {because you have (to run)[inf] a little as you[s] land}[e-r]. {It[s] depends[vxs] on the wind}[t-n], but[j] {(the idea)[s] is[x] (to keep)[inf] moving[ger] so that you (don’t)[x] just crash into the ground}[t-n].
