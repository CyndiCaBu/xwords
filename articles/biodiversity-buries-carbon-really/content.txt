(Thanks to some grants and the help of many hardworking volunteers,)[f] {(Long Island City)[s] has[x] been[v] getting greener.}[t] {There[s] are[x] many new plants growing in tree pits.}[t] {Most[s] are[x] perennials,}[t] (which means that they’ll come back every year.)[extra]

{Why did[x] people[s] add[v] plants to places meant for trees?}[t] {They[s] were[x] trying[v] (to follow)[inf] one clear rule:}[t] (no bare soil!)[extra]

{It[s] is[x] important (to keep)[inf] the ground covered at all times.}[t] {That[s] can[x] mean[v] covering it[s] with plants that we enjoy looking at,}[t] (such as flowers.)[extra] {It[s] also means[vxs] using plants that help nourish the soil.}[t] {(Lentils and peas)[s], (for instance,)[extra] help[vxo] build nitrogen underground}[t]. {(Some types of radish)[s] help[vxo] reduce compaction,}[t] (a problem in urban areas.)[extra] {People[s] often walk[vxo] right over the soil}[t] {without realizing they[s]('re)[x] squashing[v] it.}[e] 

(If it[s]'s too cold to plant plants,)[f] {(compost and mulch)[s] can[x] cover[v] the soil and help[v] nourish it[s] for spring.}[t] {Plants[s] help[vxo] capture carbon in the soil;}[t] {they[s]('re)[x] a serious tool in reducing climate change.}[t] {They[s] can[x] also brighten[v] an industrial area and encourage[v] people (to take)[inf] care of street trees by watering them.}[t]

{(The red and yellow flowers in this picture)[s] were[x] still blooming[v] in mid-November,}[t] but[j]{( the plants)[s] were[x] definitely getting[v] ready for winter.}[t] (Even as the flowers turn to seeds,)[f] {(these plants)[s] are[x] a powerful symbol of life and hope.}[t] Meanwhile[l], {(their roots and all the beneficial organisms below ground)[s] are[x] helping[v] the soil.}[t]

(In a city as big and complex as New York,)[f] {it[s] makes[vxs] sense for people (to help)[inf] take care of the trees.}[t] {While many (aren’t)[x] interested in that at all,}[f] {others are[x] really happy}[t] (when they find out they can[x] help.)[e] (By watering trees, removing weeds, planting perennials, and adding mulch and compost,)[f] {you[s] can[x] treat[v] a tree pit like your own tiny garden.}[t] However[l], {you[s] need[vxo] (to remember)[inf] that it('s)[x] a public space.}[t] {(New York City law)[s] says[vxs] that anything you[s] put in a tree pit becomes property of the city}[t] (- even plants you[s] bought with your own money.)[extra] {It[s]('s)[x] worth it[s]}[t] (when you[s] notice the difference between bare tree pits and ones that are[x] full of green plants.)[e] {Look[vxo] at young trees that people have[x] taken care of and those that have[x] struggled to survive on their own.}[t] (If you[s] like breathing oxygen,)[f] {you[s] might[x] want[v] (to consider)[inf] helping your nearest trees!}[t]
