Thanks to a grant from Partnerships for Parks and the Greening Western Queens Program, as well as the help of many hardworking volunteers, Long Island City is getting greener. There are many new plants growing in tree pits near LaGuardia Community College, and more will come in spring 2015. They’re all perennials, which means that they’ll come back every year.

Why did we add plants to places meant for trees? We’re trying to follow one easy rule: no naked soil! In other words, we know how important it is to keep the ground covered at all times. That can mean covering it with plants that we enjoy looking at, or plants that we use mostly to nourish the soil, or at the very least, compost and mulch. With plants, an important purpose is to help capture carbon in the soil and brighten an industrial area. They may also encourage people to take care of street trees by watering them.

The red and yellow flowers here were still blooming in mid-November, but the plants were definitely getting ready for winter. Even as the flowers turn to seeds, these plants are a powerful symbol of life and hope. Meanwhile, their roots and all the beneficial organisms below ground are helping the soil.
In a city as big and complex as New York, it makes sense for people to help take care of the trees. While many aren’t interested in that at all, others are really happy when they find out they can help by watering trees, removing weeds, planting perennials, and adding mulch and compost. You can see the difference between young trees that people take care of and those that have to struggle to survive on their own. If you like breathing oxygen, you might want to consider helping your nearest trees!
