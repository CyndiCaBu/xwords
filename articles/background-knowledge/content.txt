{As soon as Lucy saw the wagon above}[f-t], {she[s] called[vxd] it a Conestoga wagon}[t-n]. {(Her background knowledge)[s] made[vxd] her think of that term}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] (wasn’t )[x] sure}[t-p-nq]. {Although she saw it in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania}[f-ct], {she[s] (didn’t)[x] know[v] about the people from the Conestoga tribe who once lived in that area}[t-p-nq]. {She[s] (didn’t)[x] realize[v] that the Conestoga river was[x] nearby either}[t-p-nq].

{Later[l], she[s] looked[vxd] for more information (to help)[inf] her identify the wagon}[t-p]. {She[s] learned[vxd] that Conestoga wagons typically had[x] a white canvas cloth cover like this one}[t-p]. {(Big wooden hoops)[s] supported[vxd] the canvas}[t-p], {like in this one}[extra]. {However[l], (the typical Conestoga wagon)[s] was[x] bigger than the one Lucy saw}[t-p]. {She[s] continued[vxd] reading (to learn)[inf] more about the people who built those wagons and the ways they used them}[t-p]. 

{Lucy[s] had[x] first learned[v] about this topic in another language}[t-p], {back when she was[x] a child}[extra]. {By reading about Conestoga wagons again in English}[f-r], {she[s] connected[vxd] what she already knew to what she was[x] reading[v]}[t-p]. {That[s] helped[vxd] her understand the text better and build more knowledge}[t-p]. 

{(Background knowledge)[s] often makes[vxs] reading easier}[t-n]. {Reading[s] often builds[vxs] background knowledge}[t-n]. {They[s] go[v] together}[t-n]. {The more we[s] read[v], the more we[s] know[v]}[t-n] - depending on what we read, how often and how well.
