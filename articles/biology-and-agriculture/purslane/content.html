<p> What <span class="xw do_class">do</span> you see in this picture? If you<span class="xw re_class">’re</span>  the person who gets paid to cut the grass in this Chicago park, you <span class="xw might_class">might</span> see a weed. On the other hand, if you <span class="xw are_class">are</span> the kind of person who <span class="xw can_class">can</span> identify an edible plant no matter where it<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> growing, you <span class="xw would_class">would</span> be correct to say that this <span class="xw is_class">is</span> purslane.</p>
<p> Purslane grows easily and spreads quickly. Some people see it as a weed and pull it out as soon as they <span class="xw can_class">can</span>. Others consider it a wild food and appreciate its flavor and nutrients. My local farmers grew purslane on purpose. I first noticed it at the farmers market a few years ago, but I <span class="xw didnt_class">didn’t</span> recognize it. One of the farmers told me that it<span class="xw s_class">’s</span> known as purslane in English and verdolaga in Spanish, and she gave me a sample to taste. Since I liked it and I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> curious, I bought some to try at home. It <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a beautiful bright green color and a fresh taste.</p>
<p>Purslane <span class="xw may_class">may</span> in fact be delicious and healthy, since it <span class="xw has_class">has</span> vitamin A, folate and other nutrients. Yet too much of it <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be harmful to people and animals. It contains cardiac glycosides and oxalic acids, which <span class="xw can_class">can</span> be toxic. Knowing that, if you<span class="xw re_class">’re</span> one of these people who thinks that everything natural <span class="xw is_class">is</span> good for us, please open your eyes to more than one source of information and more than one point of view. You <span class="xw can_class">can</span> grow purslane and eat it if you want; just <span class="xw dont_class">don’t</span> eat too much at one time.</p>
