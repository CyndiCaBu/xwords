<p>The sun <span class="xw was_class">was</span> shining, but the temperature <span class="xw was_class">was</span> only about 20 degrees Fahrenheit, minus 7 Celsius. The combination of such cold air and strong winds led to a wind chill advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service. They warned of the danger of frostbite and hypothermia, giving this advice: "Outdoor exposure <span class="xw should_class">should</span> be limited. If you <span class="xw are_class">are</span> heading outdoors, dress in layers and keep your hands and head covered to protect against frostbite."</p>
<p>Erik Hoversten <span class="xw was_class">was</span> following this advice for the most part, but not 100 per cent. He <span class="xw was_class">was</span> working at the Sunnyside Greenmarket in Queens, accepting food scraps as part of the NYC Compost Project, and he <span class="xw had_class">had</span> already spent about 4 hours outside when I saw him. People from the neighborhood <span class="xw were_class">were</span>  used to going to the market to buy vegetables and drop off their vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, paper bags and other materials to be composted. If no one from the NYC Compost Project <span class="xw had_class">had</span> been there to accept those things, they <span class="xw would_class">would</span> probably just go to the trash. That <span class="xw wouldnt_class">wouldn't</span> be the most efficient option for the city or the the compost project.</p>
<p>Erik <span class="xw had_class">had</span> a sign saying, "I braved the cold for NYC Compost Project." It also mentioned the idea of giving back, which <span class="xw is_class">is</span> central to the project. People who understand the value of compost for healthy soil and plants make the effort to drop off their compostable materials. It <span class="xw doesnt_class">doesn't</span> take a lot of effort, but it<span class="xw is_class">'s</span> a little more work than just throwing everything in the trash. Instead of just rotting in the trash under layers of plastic and all kinds of stuff, those materials break down over time. The compost pile actually gets hot as the bacteria help decompose organic matter. Over time, it all turns into what some call "black gold." That<span class="xw is_class">'s</span> when the NYC Compost Project gives back to the community, offering people a valuable source of fertilizer.</p>
<p>On this Saturday in February, a day after Abraham Lincoln's birthday and a day before Valentine's Day, I almost <span class="xw didnt_class">didn't</span> go to the compost drop off. The wind <span class="xw was_class">was</span> painful as it hit my skin, but I <span class="xw was_class">was</span> dressed in layers and I covered up with a scarf. Getting compost back <span class="xw was_class">was</span> a wonderful reward.</p>
