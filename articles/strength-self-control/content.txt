{(The morning rush hour)[s] filled[vxd] the streets of the Lower East Side with cars and trucks}[t-p]. {Jasmin[s] was[x] walking to work from the subway station}[t-p], {covering her mouth and nose at the smell of exhaust}[extra]. {When she crossed Sara Roosevelt Park}[f-t], {(the trees there)[s] made[vxd] her feel better}[t-p]. {They[s] were[x] a welcome break between the uptown traffic on one side of the park and the downtown traffic on the other}[t-p].

{Appreciating the shade}[extra], {she[s] stood[vxd] on the corner waiting for her turn (to cross)[inf] Chrystie Street}[t-p]. {Cars[s] zoomed[vxd] past}[t-p], {trying to get through the stoplight before it changed}[e-r]. {Jasmin[s] kept[vxd] her eyes on that light}[t-p]. {As soon as it turned red for the cars}[f-t], {she[s] stepped[vxd] off the curb (to keep)[inf] walking west}[t-p]. Suddenly[l], {(a biker)[s] crossed[vxd] her path}[t-p], {almost hitting her}[extra]. {She[s] stopped[vxd] just in time and yelled[vxd] something at the biker}[t=p]. {Without stopping}[f-r], {he[s] yelled[vxd] back, spit[vxd] at her and sped[vxd] away}[t=p].

{Disgusted but relieved the saliva (didn’t)[x] hit her face}[extra], {Jasmin[s] paused[vxd] (to clean)[inf] it off her bag}[t-p]. {Although she understood the pressures and dangers of riding a bike in the city}[f-ct], {she[s] was[x] angry at the biker’s behavior}[t-p]. {What made[vxd] him so aggressive}[t-p-nq]? {It[s] was[x] her turn (to cross)[inf] the street}[t-p]; {for him}[f-r] {(the light)[s] was[x] red}[t-p]. {Was[x] his problem[s] ignorance or arrogance}[t-p-nq]?

{Jasmin[s] kept[vxd] walking to work}[t-p], {thinking about self-control}[e-r]. {(That biker)[s] (didn’t)[x] show[v] any}[t-p](;)[j] {he[s] (didn’t)[x] even let[v] the traffic laws control his behavior}[t-p]. {She[s] felt[vxd] proud of herself for not cursing at him}[t-p]. {She[s] was[x] trying[v] (to become)[inf] more polite and increase her self-control}[t-p]. {She[s] thought[vxd] about what she(’d)[x] learned by studying self-regulation as a strength in positive psychology}[t-p].

{When our glucose level drops}[f-t], {it[s](’s)[x] harder (to control)[inf] ourselves}[t-n]. {(Eating just a bit or drinking something with a little sugar)[s] can[x] help[v]}[t-n]. {(Jasmin’s big breakfast)[s] gave[vxd] her an advantage}[t-p].

{Use[vxo] it or lose[vxo] it}[t-n-nq]. {By using self-control on purpose in other parts of our lives}[f-r], {(our self-control)[s] gets[vxs] stronger}[t-n] – {like a muscle}[extra]. {In addition to trying not (to say)[inf] bad words}[l], {Jasmin was[x] trying (to save)[inf] money by taking snacks to work}[t-p]. {So far}[f-t], {she[s](’d)[x] saved[dtn] an average of $30 a month}[t-p].

{(Valuing ourselves)[s] helps[vxs] us regulate ourselves}[t-n]. {In other words}[l], {(self-love)[s] can[x] increase[v] self-control}[t-n]. {Jasmin[s] was[x] already feeling[v] good about her decision (to walk)[inf] near the park}[t-p], and[j] {she[s] started[vxd] the day by saying a few positive things to herself in the mirror}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] both funny and helpful}[t-p].

{(Self-control)[s] is[x] significant in academic success}[t-n]. {According to some researchers}[f-r], {it[s](’s)[x] more important than intelligence}[t-n]. {Jasmin[s] was[x] keeping[v] track of the time she spent reading outside of work every day and trying (to increase)[inf] it by 10 minutes a week}[t-n]. {She[s] was[x] preparing[v] for college and working on self-regulation as a way (to develop)[inf] strong study habits}[t-p].
