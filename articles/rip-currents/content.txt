{Which would[x] scare[v] you[s] more at the beach}[t-n-nq]: {feeling the water pull you out towards the deeper parts, like a magnet that you (can’t)[x] resist[v]}[extra]? {Or getting knocked over by a big wave, so that you(’re)[x] suddenly underwater and not sure which way is[x] up}[extra]? 

{(Both of those situations)[s] could[x] be[v] dangerous}[t-n], {especially if you (don’t)[x] know[v] how (to swim)[inf] or you(’re)[x] not comfortable in the water}[extra]. {Since you can[x] see[v] big waves easily}[f-r], {they[s] might[x] be[v] easier (to avoid)[inf]}[t-n]. {(Those invisible magnets pulling you far from shore)[s] can[x] be[v] trickier}[t-n]. {They[s](’re)[x] not actually magnets}[t-n], {of course}[extra]. {They[s](’re)[x] called[v] rip currents}[t-n].

{(Rip currents)[s] are[x] strong, narrow flows of water that extend away from the shore}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] happen[v] at any beach with breaking waves}[t-n], {not just at the ocean}[extra]. Sometimes[l] {they[s] look[vxo] like flat, smooth water between the breaking waves}[t-n]. {You[s] can[x] see[v] that}[t-n] {in 2 parts of the photo above}[e-p]. {It[s] might[x] seem[v] like a safe place (to get)[inf] away from the waves}[t-n-nq], but[j] {(the foam)[s] is[x] a clue to danger}[t-n]. {Under that flat surface}[f-p], {(the water)[s] is[x] offering[v] a fast, one-way trip away from the shore}[t-n] - {on a rip current}[extra]. 

{According to Greg Dusek}[l], {a scientist with the National Ocean Service}[extra], {(rip currents)[s] can[x] last[v] for minutes}[t-n] - {or months}[extra]. {They[s] can[x] range[v] from 15 to 100 meters wide}[t-n], and[j] {they[s] can[x] stretch[v] offshore from 100 to 400 meters}[t-n]. 

{(Rip currents)[s] are[x] caused[v] by breaking waves}[t-n], {including low, small waves}[extra]. {(Hard structures)[s] focus[vxo] the wave energy}[t-n], so[j] {they[s] can[x] have[v] rip currents almost all the time}[t-n]. {This[s] includes[vxs] structures like a jetty, pier, or rocky outcrop}[t-n].  

{(Rip currents)[s] are[x] strongest}[t-n] {at low tide}[e-t], but[j] {they[s] can[x] happen[v] at other times}[t-n], too[extra]. {They[s] (don’t)[x] pull[v] you under the water}[t-n]. Eventually[l], {they[s] break[vxo] up and let[v] you go}[t-n]. {(The problem)[s] is[x] that they take you out so fast that you might[x] lose[v] control or panic}[t-n]. So[l] {what can[x] you[s] do[v]}[t-n-nq] {if you find yourself in a rip current}[e-cd]?

# SWIM PARALLEL TO SHORE

{(To get)[inf] out of a rip current}[f-r], {you[s] must[x] turn[v] to the side}[t-n-nq] - {not towards the shore}[extra]. {You[s] need[vxo] (to swim)[inf] parallel to the shore}[t-n], {either to the right or the left of the rip current}[extra]. {Focus[v] on the facts}[t-n-nq]: {(the rip current)[s] will[x] not pull[v] you under the water}[t-n]. {It[s] just wants[vxs] (to take)[inf] you for a ride}[t-n], {faster than an Olympic swimmer}[extra] - {possibly tempting, but definitely dangerous}[extra]. {You[s] can[x] say[v] no}[t-n]. {As long as you go off to the side}[f-cd], {not towards the shore}[extra], {you[s] can[x] escape[v] the pull of the current}[t-n]. 

{If you feel yourself starting (to panic)[inf]}[f-cd], {focus[v] on keeping your head above water and looking for resources}[t-n]. {Look[v] for other people and shout to them for help}[t-n-nq]. {Look[v] for a place where the waves are[x] breaking[v]}[t-n-nq]. {That[s] might[x] be[v] a sandbar}[t-n-nq], and[j] {(the water there)[s] might[x] be[v] shallow enough for you (to stand)[inf] up, catch[v] your breath and shout[v] for help again}[t-n-nq]. {Look[v] for a place where the water is[x] flowing[v] onto the beach instead of away from it}[t-n]. {If you can[x] get[v] there safely}[f-cd], {(that water)[s] can[x] save[v] you by carrying you back to shore}[t-n].  

{What if you get stuck in a rip current but you (can’t)[x] swim[v]}[t-n-nq]? OK. {You[s] can[x] float[v], wave[v] your arms and call[v] for help}[t-n]. {Even if the water is[x] pulling[v] you out}[f-cd], {you[s] can[x] keep[v] floating}[t-n-nq]. {Remind[v] yourself that the water flows in more than one direction}[t-n-nq] - {out, yes, but not forever}[extra]. {When the current breaks}[f-t], {you[s] can[x] turn[v] to the side (to find)[inf] another current taking you back to the shore}[t-n]. {Focus[v] on floating and breathing}[t-n-nq], {head above water}[extra]. {If you can[x] yell[v] for help}[f-cd], {do[v] it}[t-n-nq]. {If you can[x] wiggle[v] your arms (to help)[inf] yourself start moving off to the side}[f-cd], {do[v] it}[t-n-nq]. {Focus[v] on what you can[x] do[v]}[t-n-nq], {not what you (can't)[x]}[extra].

# STAY ONSHORE

{What if you are[x] on the beach and you see another person caught in a rip current}[t-n-nq]? {(Don't)[x] follow your instinct (to rush)[inf] into the water (to save)[inf] them}[t-n-nq]. {You[s] would[x] have[v] a higher chance of drowning than of succeeding}[t-n]. Instead[l], {use[v] your adrenaline (to yell)[inf] for a lifeguard and throw[v] the person something that will[x] float[v]}[t-n]. {Lifeguards always take[vxo] a flotation device with them}[t-n] {when they go into the water (to rescue)[inf] someone}[e-t] {because they know the risks}[e-r].

# KNOW BEFORE YOU GO.

{(Dr. Dusek and others)[s] recommend[vxo] checking the water conditions before you even go to the beach}[t-n]. {Whether it('s)[x] the ocean, a lake, or a big river}[f-cd], {you[s] need[vxo] (to spend)[inf] some time observing the water}[t-n] {before going close to it}[e-t]. {When you get to the beach}[e-t],  {stand[v] back}[t-n-nq], {up higher if possible}[extra]. {Find[v] a clear view of the water surface}[t-n-nq] and[j] {observe[v] it for a few minutes}[t-n-nq]. {If you see foam and different colors of water with sand and sediment}[f-cd], {you[s] are[x] probably looking[v] at a rip current}[t-n]. {If you notice a flat, calm-looking section of water between breaking waves}[f-cd], {(don't)[x] let[v] it fool you}[t-n-nq]. {It[s](’s)[x] a channel of flowing water}[t-n], {flowing fast and out, away from the shore}[extra] - {a rip current}[extra]. 

# IF IN DOUBT, DON'T[x] GO[v] OUT.

{(Staying out of the water)[s] is[x] the easiest way (to avoid)[inf] getting caught in a rip current}[t-n]. {(Another way)[s] is[x] (to make)[inf] sure you always go in the water near a lifeguard}[t-n]. {They will[x] warn[v] you about dangerous water conditions}[t-n], and[j] {they[s] can[x] rescue[v] you}[t-n] {if needed}[e-cd]. 

{If you (don’t)[x] like[v] the water but you have[x] friends who do[x]}[f-cd], {please share this information with them}[t-n-nq]. {Ask[v] them what they know about rip currents}[t-n-nq]. {Can[x] they[s] describe[x] them to you accurately}[t-n-nq]? {Show[v] them the picture above and in the thumbnail}[t-n-nq], {both from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association}[extra]. {Ask[v] them if they have[x] any good stories about sandbars and why they (don't)[x] swim[v] near jetties, piers or rock formations}[t-n-nq]. {Find[v] out if they always swim near lifeguards}[t-n-nq], {or if not, why not}[extra]. 

{We[s] can[x] all benefit[v] from reminding ourselves that Mother Nature (doesn't)[x] always love[v] us}[t-n]. {We[s] might[x] think[v] we are[x] strong and competent}[t-n], but[j] {water[s] can[x] be[v] full of surprises}[t-n]. {We[s]('re)[x] better off respecting its power from the beginning}[t-n].
