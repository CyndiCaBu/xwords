{(Tom Fruin)[s] is[x] an artist born in Los Angeles, California}[t-n]. {He[s] has[x] exhibited[dtn] his work}[t-p] {around the world}[e-p] {in places as far apart as Buenos Aires, Argentina  and Copenhagen, Denmark}[e-p]. {He[s] has[x] also lived[dtn] and worked[dtn] in Brooklyn, New York}[t-p] {for many years}[e-t].

{(One of the interesting aspects of Fruinâ€™s art)[s] is[x] the way he makes things from found objects}[t-n]. {He[s] creates[vxs] beautiful and/or interesting work from what might[x]  seem like trash}[t-n]. {He[s] has[x] made[dtn] several pieces from small plastic bags that were[x] thrown away by people using illegal drugs}[t-p]. {He[s] collected[vxd] the bags from parks and sidewalks and sewed[vxd] them together (to make)[inf] what he called (urban quilts)[title]}[t=p]. Obviously[l] {those[s] are[x] not the types of quilts that can[x] keep you warm on a cold night}[t-n], but[j] {you[s] could[x] use[v] his work (to think)[inf] about drug problems in a different way}[t-n].

{(The water tower pictured here)[s] was[x] made[dtn] from around 1,000 pieces of colorful plexiglass held together by steel}[t-p]. {Instead of water}[f-r], {it[s] has[vxs] a light installation inside}[t-n], {created by artist Ryan Holsopple}[extra]. {You[s] can[x] see[v] the tower}[t-n] {from the East River and other parts of Brooklyn}[e-p]. {Under the Manhattan Bridge}[f-p], {there[s] are[x] some good spots (to get)[inf] a closer view}[t-n]. {One[s] is[x] in a park}[t-n], and[j] {another[s] is[x] next to a building}[t-n]. 

{(Another Tom Fruin water tower)[s] sits[vxs]}[t-n] {along the BQE}[e-p] {south of the tower described above}[extra]. {(Other Fruin pieces)[s] can[x] be[v] found in other parts of Brooklyn, as well as in Queens and elsewhere}[t-n]. {(His work)[s] is[x] in private collections and galleries in addition to public spaces}[t-n]. {If you like it}[f-cd], {(visiting it)[s] (is)[x] one way (to practice)[inf] appreciating beauty and excellence}[t-n].
