 Tom Fruin is an artist who was  born in Los Angeles, California. He has exhibited his work around the world, in places as far apart as Buenos Aires, Argentina  and Copenhagen, Denmark. Like other artists who would like to show their work and probably sell it, he is represented by a gallery. Although Fruin has lived in and worked in Brooklyn, New York for many years, the gallery that represents his work is  in Geneva, Switzerland. 
 One of the interesting aspects of Fruin’s art is the way he makes things from found objects. That means he can  create something beautiful and/or interesting from what might  seem like trash. He has made several pieces from small plastic bags that were thrown away by people using marijuana and other drugs. He collected the bags from parks and sidewalks and then sewed them together to make what he called “urban quilts.” Obviously those are not the types of quilts that can keep you warm on a cold night, but you could  use his work to think about drug problems in a different way. 
 The water tower pictured here was made from around 1,000 pieces of colorful plexiglass, which are held together by steel. It doesn’t  have any water inside, of course, but it does have a light installation by another artist, Ryan Holsopple. You can  see the tower from the East River and other parts of Brooklyn, but if you would  rather get a closer view, you can  find a good spot to look at it from under the Manhattan Bridge. When you first get to DUMBO, the area found “Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass,” it might be hard to see the water tower, but if you keep looking, you’ll  find it.
