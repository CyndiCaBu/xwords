{(The ten questions below)[s] are[x] examples of curiosity}[t-n]. {They[s] were[x] inspired[dtn] by an image from SOIL}[t-n], {Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods}[extra]. {SOIL[s] turns[vxs] waste into resources}[t-n] {in Haiti}[e-p]. {In the process}[f-r], {it[s] provides[vxs] dignity as well as jobs and chances (to learn)[inf] and become healthier}[t-n]. {It[s] uses[vxs] the poop loop (to create)[inf] positive change}[t-n].

{If you[s] had[vxd] a choice between plants grown with chemical fertilizer or plants grown with humanure}[f-cd], {which would[x] you[s] choose[v]}[t-n-nq]?
