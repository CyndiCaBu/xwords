{In the United States,}[f-p] {(the second Monday in October)[s] is[x] a federal holiday.}[t] {That[s] means[vxs] public schools and other government institutions  are[x] closed.}[t] {(The holiday)[s] is[x] officially in honor of Christopher Columbus,}[t] {a man who was[x] born in Italy in 1451.}[extra] {It[s]('s)[x] also a chance (to practice)[inf] critical thinking,}[t] {especially the skill of considering different points of view.}[extra] {(What Columbus did[x] between his birth in Italy and his death in Spain about 50 years later)[s] is[x] what really matters.}[t]

{For many Italian Americans and others,}[f-r] {Columbus[s]  was[x]a hero.}[t] {Like other European explorers of his era,}[extra] {he[s] left[vxd] home (to learn)[inf] about other parts of the world and bring back riches and information for his sponsors.}[t] {Long before the internet and our ability (to fly)[inf] far away for a relatively low economic cost,}[f-t] {you[s] (couldn't)[x] really know[v] much about any place or people far from your own home.}[t]  {You[s] could[x] only imagine[v] and listen[v] to stories from traders who traveled by land.}[t]  {Without accurate maps,}[extra] {(people on one continent)[s] (didn't)[x] even know[v] about different people on another.}[t]

{There[s] was[x] debate and ignorance about the shape of our planet.}[t] {Did[x] (the world)[s] end[v] at the horizon?}[t] {If you[s] sailed a ship all the way out to that line where the water meets the sky,}[f-cd] {would[x] you[s] fall[v] off the edge of the earth?}[t] {These[s] were[x] just a few of the uncertainties that made travel so risky}[t] {over 5 centuries ago.}[e-t] {When people claim that Columbus was[x] a brave leader,}[f-t] {this[s] might[x] be[v] partly what they have[x] in mind.}[t]

{That[s]('s)[x] one way (to look)[inf] at Columbus:}[t] {an explorer who opened up a whole "new world" to Europe.}[extra] {He[s] (wasn't)[x] the first European (to arrive)[inf] in the Americas;}[t] {(other explorers)[s] had[x] crossed[v] the Atlantic from northern Europe about 500 years earlier.}[t] {Called Vikings, or Norsemen,}[extra] {they[s] came[vxd] from the area we now call Scandinavia:}[t] {countries like Denmark, Norway and Sweden.}[extra] However[l], {while the Vikings ended up colonizing and changing parts of Europe,}[f-ct] {(Columbus' journey)[s] led[vxd] Spain and other European countries (to colonize)[inf] and utterly transform the Americas.}[t]

(Ironically,)[l] {Columbus[s] was[x] actually looking for India,}[t] {a source of valuable herbs and spices that (didn't)[x] grow[v] in northern Europe.}[extra] {He[s] was[x] hoping[v] (to find)[inf] a shorter path to gold and other riches for his sponsors in Spain.}[t] However[l], {after a difficult journey full of storms, doubts, ill health and other trouble,}[f-t] {(he and his crew)[s] landed[vxd] in the Caribbean.}[t] (Still confused,)[extra] {they[s] referred[vxd] to the people there as "Indians,"}[t] but[j] {they[s] may[x] not have[v] even seen[dtn] them as fully human.}[t] {(Neither group) understood[vxd] the other;}[t] {they[s] lacked[vxd] the appreciation of diversity that helps people of different cultures live together today.}[t] {Without a way (to communicate)[inf] clearly and ask questions about each other('s)[x] families, manners, clothing, and more,}[f-r] {(the Europeans and the native Caribbeans)[s] did[x] not get[v] along well at all,}[t] (to say the least.)[extra]

{(Those who still honor Columbus)[s] say[vxo] he discovered the Americas.}[t] {(Those who see the connection between his voyage and the subsequent disasters of exploitation, territorial invasion and even genocide)[s] may[x] have[v] a different perspective.}[t] (In the words of an elderly man from the Dominican Republic,)[extra] {"Columbus[s] was[x] an assassin and a traitor!"}[t] Perhaps[l] {we[s] (don't)[x] have[v] enough evidence (to verify)[inf] stories about Columbus and/or his crew demanding gold and committing atrocities,}[t] but[j] {we[s] do[x] know[v] that millions and millions of native people died.}[t] {Violence[s] was[x] one factor;}[t] {disease[s] was[x] another.}[t] {(Living in close contact with animals,)[s] (even sleeping near them for warmth,)[extra] had[x] helped[v] Europeans develop resistance to germs that devastated people born and raised far away.}[t]

{The more we look into history (to compare)[inf] different points of view,}[extra] {(the more interesting questions)[s] we can[x] ask[v].}[t] {Did[x] (either side,)[s] {the Europeans or the native Caribbeans,}[extra] respect[v] what we now call human rights in their own societies?}[t] {Is[x] it[s] fair (to use)[inf] our modern sense of justice when we look at the past?}[t] {Are[x] you[s] ready (to join)[inf] those who prefer (to call)[inf] this holiday Indigenous People('s) Day?}[t]
