{What did[x] you see first in the image above}[t-n-nq]? {If you noticed the large, green gourd in the foreground}[f-cd], {did[x] you[s] also see[v] the smaller ones behind it}[t-n-nq]? {Did[x] (the green leaves and vines)[s] catch[v] your attention}[t-n-nq], or[j] {did[x] you[s] notice[v] the yellow and brown leaves on the right}[t-n-nq]? 

{(The green plant)[s] goes[v] by many names}[t-n], {including birdhouse gourd, bottle gourd, calabash and others}[extra]. {In the picture}[f-p], {it[s]('s)[x] growing[v] on another plant}[t-n], {a shrub called photinia}[extra]. {(That shrub)[s] had[x] been[v] dying for a few years}[t-p], but[j] {it[s] still had[v] some healthy sections}[t-p]. {(The gardener)[s] (didn't)[x] want[v] (to get)[inf] rid of it yet}[t-p], but[j] {she[s] (didn't)[x] want[v] (to look)[inf] at the dead branches all summer either}[t-p]. 

{She[s] decided[v] (to plant)[inf] a birdhouse gourd (to cover)[inf] the dying shrub}[t-p]. {As an upward-growing vine}[extra], {(the birdhouse gourd)[s] wanted[v] (to climb)[inf]}[t-p]. {All summer long}[f-t], {it[s] grew[v] taller and taller}[t-p], {filling the dead branches with big green leaves and more than a dozen gourds}[extra]. 

{(The growth direction of the vine)[s] is[x] a useful model for us}[t-n]. {With a focus on positive emotions}[f-r], {we[s] can[x] open[v] our minds to more ideas}[t-n]. {(The vine)[s] grows[v] up and spreads[v]}[t-n], {like the upward growth and spiral of positive emotions}[extra].

Think about the last time you felt awe. {Did[x] (that feeling)[s] also include[v] other positive ones like serenity and joy}[t-p]? {(One positive emotion)[s] can[x] lead[v] to another in an upward spiral}[t-n]. {(This way of thinking)[s] can[x] help[v] us become more optimistic and resilient}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] help[v] us learn and connect with others in a healthy way}[t-n]. {It[s] may[x] even have[v] a positive impact on our physical health}[t-n].

{(Negative emotions)[s], (on the other hand)[l], can[x] take[v] us in the other direction}[t-n] - {a downward spiral}[extra]. Consider a time when you felt frustrated. {Did[x] that[s] also lead[v] to feeling angry or sad}[t-p-nq]? {(The downward spiral)[s] might[x] be[v] easy (to fall)[inf] into}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] can[x] hurt[v] us in ways we (don't)[x] expect[v]}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] interfere[v] with learning and distract[v] us from our opportunities}[t-n]. {(The downward spiral)[s] can[x] damage[v] our relationships and possibly our health}[t-n].

{It[s] would[x] be[v] unrealistic (to expect)[inf] positive emotions all the time}[t-n]. {(The point)[s] is[x] (to find)[inf] a balance and understand[v] what our emotions mean}[t-n]. {(A negative emotion like annoyance)[s] might[x] be[v] a sign that we need (to take)[inf] action (to solve)[inf] a problem}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] get[v] stuck complaining or do[v] what needs (to be)[inf] done}[t-n]. {For instance}[l], {(a person with a leaky faucet)[s] could[x] spend[v] several weeks whining about it}[t-n], {feeling frustrated and annoyed}[extra]. Or[l] {they[s] could[x] avoid[v] that downward spiral by fixing the leak}[t-n]. {If they have the tools and skills (to fix)[inf] it themselves}[f-cd], {that[s] might[x] lead[v] to positive emotions like interest and pride}[t-n] - {in an upward spiral}[extra].

{Which spiral will[x] you[s] choose[v] right now}[t-n-nq]?
