Broaden and build

What did you see first in the image above? If you noticed the large, green gourd in the foreground, did you also see the smaller ones behind it? Did the green leaves and vines catch your attention, or did you notice the yellow and brown leaves on the right? 

The green plant goes by many names, including birdhouse gourd, bottle gourd, calabash and others. In the picture, it's growing on another plant, a shrub called photinia. That shrub had been dying for a few years, but it still had some healthy sections. The gardener didn't want to get rid of it yet, but she didn't want to look at the dead branches all summer. 

She decided to plant a birdhouse gourd to cover the dying shrub. As an upward-growing vine, the birdhouse gourd wanted to climb. During the summer months, it grew taller and taller, filling the dead branches with big green leaves and more than a dozen gourds. 

The growth direction of the vine is a useful model for us. With a focus on positive emotions, we can open our minds and think of more ideas. The vines grows up and spreads, like the upward growth and spiral of positive emotions.

Think about the last time you felt awe. Did that feeling also include other positive ones like serenity and joy? One positive emotion can lead to another in an upward spiral. This way of thinking can help us become more optimistic and resilient. It can help us learn and connect to others in a healthy way. It may even have a positive impact on our physical health.

Negative emotions, on the other hand, can take us in the other direction - a downward spiral. Consider a time when you felt frustrated. Did that also lead to feeling angry or sad? The downward spiral might be easy to fall into, but it can hurt us in ways we don't expect. It can interfere with learning and distract us from our opportunities. It can damage our relationships and possibly our health.

It would be unrealistic to expect positive emotions all the time. The point is to find a balance and understand what our emotions mean. A negative emotion like annoyance might be a sign that we need to take action to solve a problem. We can get stuck complaining or do what needs to be done. For instance, a person with a leaky faucet can spend several weeks whining about it, feeling frustrated and annoyed. Or they can avoid that downward spiral by fixing the leak. If they have the tools and skills to fix it themselves, that might lead to positive emotions like interest and pride - in an upward spiral.
