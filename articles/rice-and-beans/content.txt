You can find people all around the world who enjoy eating fish and rice, or rice and beans, or all three. This picture was taken by the filmmaker Naheem Adio, but he didn’t tell me who dropped the food or how or why. It could be from the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, so it might be from a street vendor. On the other hand, it could also be from a restaurant.
Wherever it was made, it looks delicious, even though it has already fallen on the sidewalk. If you use your imagination, you can almost feel the lettuce and peppers crunching between your teeth. Depending where you’re  from, maybe you can feel your fingers pulling pieces of the fish away from the skin and the bones. Perhaps you’d  prefer a fork, which would be cleaner but a little more difficult than your fingers. The tomato looks like it might be firm and not as juicy as a farm fresh tomato, but we can pretend that it’s  full of flavor. The rice and beans look tasty, too. 
The whole dish looks something that someone was really looking forward to eating. Too bad it ended up where it did!
