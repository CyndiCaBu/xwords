{You[s] can[x] find[v] people all around the world who enjoy eating[ger] fish and rice, or rice and beans, or all three}[t-n]. {(The food shown here)[s] was[x] photographed[dtn] by the filmmaker Naheem Adio}[t-p]. {He[s] (didn’t)[x] tell[x] me who dropped it, how or why}[t-p]. {It[s] could[x] be[v] from the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn}[t-n], so[j] {it[s] might[x] be[v] from a street vendor}[t-n]. {On the other hand}[l], {it[s] could[x] also be[v] from a restaurant}[t-n].

{Wherever it was[x] made}[f-p], {(this food)[s] looks[vxs] delicious}[t-n] {even though it has[x] already fallen on the street}[e-ct]. {If you use your imagination}[f-cd], {you[s] can[x] almost feel[v] the lettuce and peppers crunching[ger] between your teeth}[t-n]. {Depending[ger] where you(’re)[x]  from}[f-cd], maybe[l] {you[s] can[x] feel[v] your fingers pulling[ger] pieces of the fish away from the skin and the bones}[t-n]. Perhaps[l] {you[s](’d )[x] prefer[v] a fork}[t-n], {which would[x] be cleaner but[j] a little more difficult than your fingers}[extra]. {(The tomato)[s] looks[vxs] like it might[x] be firm and not as juicy as a farm fresh tomato}[t-n], but[j] {we[s] can[x] pretend[v] that it(’s)[x]  full of flavor}[t-n]. {(The rice and beans)[s] look[v] tasty}[t-n], (too)[extra].
 
{(The whole dish)[s] looks[vxs] like something that someone was[x] really looking[vg] forward to eating[ger]}[t-n]. {Too bad it[s] ended[vxd] up where it did[x]}[t-p-nq]!
