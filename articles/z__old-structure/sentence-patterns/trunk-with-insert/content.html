If you want to make your writing sound more sophisticated, start with a trunk (SVO). Then add more information to the subject, the verb, or the object. We call this extra information an insert, because you insert it into the sentence. This pattern is Trunk + Insert.

Examples (notice the way the commas separate the extra info)
