A linker is a word or phrase that connects the ideas between 1 sentence and the next. (Link means connect.) Linkers usually go at the beginning of a sentence, so they start with a captial letter. Put a comma after the linker. This pattern is called Linker, Trunk (L,T). 

Many linkers mean the same thing as some of the common joiner words (and, but, so, etc.). The difference is in their position in a sentence. Linkers go at the beginning, before the trunk. Joiners go in the middle, between 2 trunks. 

Here are some common linkers, organized by their meaning:

The flowers look like little trumpets, with the pollen deep inside. They grow in clusters on a long, green stalk. Although the digitalis plant itself is only a biennial, lasting for 2 years, it can reproduce. As a result, it can be somewhat invasive, and some gardeners might even consider it a weed.
