A trunk is a complete sentence, because it has SVO. Notice the period at the end!

One way to add more information to the same sentence is by adding another trunk. 

The result is a longer complete sentence made of SVO + SVO, which we call Trunk + Trunk or T, + T. 

Note: If you have trouble with run-on sentences, your solution starts here. In SVO + SVO, you  must  fill the + position with one of these joiners (connector words), NOT a comma:

and
but
so
or
; (pronounced semi-colon; used instead of and)
for (meaning because)
yet (meaning but)
NOT just a comma! (comma before the joiner)

Examples:

These two trees are different, but they grew so close they almost look connected.

The one on the left is probably a white birch; you can tell by its color and the peeling bark.
