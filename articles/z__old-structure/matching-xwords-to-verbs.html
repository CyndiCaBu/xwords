X-words have to match verb forms. The rules below are true 100% of the time; there are no exceptions.

<table class="conversion-table">

<tr class="conversion-firstrow">

<tr>
<td><strong>Do family: </strong>do, does, did</td>
<td>Base Form</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <strong>Modals</strong>: can, could, will, would, shall, should, must, might, may</td>
<td>Base Form</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Have family:</strong> have, has, had</td>
<td>DTN form</td>

<p>Mark x-words in your own writing. Then look to the right of each x-word. Find the verb. Is it in the right form?</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: In x-word grammar, the names for verb forms make sense when you understand them. We say <strong>DTN</strong> instead of &#8220;past participle&#8221; because there&#8217;s nothing past about the past participle. The time is in the x-word, not in the verb form.</p>
<p><em>Examples of verb forms</em>:<br />
<strong>base form</strong>: come, go, say, see<br />
<strong>DTN form</strong>: come, gone, said, seen<br />
<strong>-ing form</strong>: coming, going, saying, seeing</p>
<p><em>Evidence that the time is in the x-word, not the verb form</em>:<br />
<strong>Now</strong>: I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I think the people in the photo are the tennis player Li Na and her coach Carlos Rodriguez.<br />
<strong>Before</strong>: I didn&#8217;t know anything about them when I saw them practice before the 2013 US Open, but soon after this photo was taken I read an interesting <em>New York Times</em> article and realized who they were.<br />
<strong>Past to now</strong>: They have known each other for years and they&#8217;ve learned a lot from their tennis collaboration.</p>
