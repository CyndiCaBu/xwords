<p>If x-words don't match subjects there will be mistakes with subject-verb agreement. The x-word editing symbol for these mistakes is <strong>SX</strong>. It means you need to look for the x-word, including hidden x-words, and check the rules below.</p>
<table class="conversion-table">
<tbody>
<tr class="conversion-firstrow">
<th>1 possible person or group:</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Subjects</strong>: He, She, It, Everyone, No one, Someone, Anyone, Family</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Now</strong>: does, has, is</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Before:</strong> did, had, was </td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="conversion-table">
<tbody>
<tr class="conversion-firstrow">
<th>Many (more than 1)</th>
<tr><td><strong>Subjects</strong>: You, We, They, People</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Now</strong>: do, have, are</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Before: </strong>did, had, were</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We put the subject <strong>you</strong> in the plural group because it matches the same x-words as the other plural subjects. We put words like <strong>everyone</strong> in the singular group because they act like 1 unit, so they match the same x-words as the other singular subjects.</p>
