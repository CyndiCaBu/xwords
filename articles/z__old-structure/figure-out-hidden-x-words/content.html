<p><strong>The DO family of x-words is the only one that can hide. To figure out if the x-word is hiding, look for the main verb. Tips below; more info <a href="http://www.xwordgrammar.com/matching-x-words-to-verbs/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<p class="DoubleSpace"><li>If you see a main verb without a visible x-word, the x-word is hiding inside the verb.</li></p>
<p class="DoubleSpace"><li>If you see an x-word without a main verb nearby, that x-word is actually a main verb, with an x-word from the DO family hiding inside it.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><strong>To find hidden x-words, try to make the sentence negative or turn it into a yes/no question. Practice with the passage and quiz below.</strong></p>

<p>Elisabeth does the dishes by hand. She has a dishwasher right next to the sink. However, she doesnâ€™t use it very often. She prefers to wash the dishes herself. She likes the feel of warm water on her hands. Instead of spending time drying the dishes with a towel, she lets them air dry. She says that making them all fit in the dish drainer is like doing a puzzle. It makes her brain work in a logical way. Her dishwashing habit probably saves electricity and water, too.</p>
