<p>The x-words are 20 short words with a lot of power. We use them all the time in English. Some of them are marked with an <strong>X </strong> in the text below:</p>
<p>To learn x-word grammar, first memorize the 20 x-words:

<strong>The DO family</strong> : do, does, did

<strong>The MODALS</strong> : can, could, will, would, shall, should, must, might, may

<strong>The HAVE family</strong> : have, has, had

<strong>The BE family</strong> : am, is, are, was, were<!--more-->

(You might call these words auxiliary verbs or modals. However, the x-words are more than the modals and they function differently, too.)

Why do the x-words matter? Here are some of their powers:

<ul>
	<li>to show <strong>time</strong> (now? before? both?)</li>
	<li>to show <strong>number </strong>(matching with one subject or more)</li>
	<li>to make <strong>questions</strong></li>
	<li>to say <strong>No </strong>(making <strong>negative</strong> statements)</li>
	<li>to express <strong>opinions</strong></li>
</ul>
To learn more x-word grammar, start noticing the x-words whenever you read in English.</p>
