<p>If you can find all of the following, you should be ready to figure out sentence patterns.
<ul>
	<li>x-words</li>
	<li>verbs (look right)</li>
	<li>subjects (look left)Â joiners (and, but, so, etc.)</li>
	<li>clues to shifters (if, when, because, etc.)</li>
	<li>linkers (however, for example, etc.)</li>
</ul>
Identifying sentence patterns can help you understand tricky parts when you read, and it can make your own writing more sophisticated and more interesting. The more you practice, the easier it will be.</p>
