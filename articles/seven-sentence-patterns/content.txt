{(Written English)[s] uses[v] seven sentence patterns}[t-n]. {(These patterns)[s] can[x] make[v] short sentences or long ones}[t-n]. {It[s] depends[v] on the writer's style and the context}[t-n].

{(Business writing)[s] uses[v] concise sentences}[t-n]. {It[s] gets[v] straight to the point}[t-n], {using enough words (to explain)[inf] but[j] nothing more than needed}[extra]. (For example)[l], {(a business email message)[s] might[x] have[v] only two or three lines}[t-n]. {It[s] greets[v] the reader, explains[v] what the writer wants or needs and ends[v] with gratitude}[t-n]. Period. 

{In other contexts}[f-p], {(the writing style)[s] depends[v] on the writer}[t-n]. {(Some people)[s] prefer[v] short, direct sentences}[t-n]. {Others[s] combine[v] sentence patterns (to write)[inf] long sentences}[t-n].  

So[l] {how can[x] you[s] learn[v] these seven sentence patterns}[t-n]? {Study[v] them below and look[v] for clues}[t-n]. First[l] {use[v] the x-word (to find)[inf] the subject, verb and object}[t-n]: {SVO}[extra]. Then[l] {look[v] at the punctuation}[t-n]. {Do[x] you[s] see[v] any commas, dashes or other punctuation marks before the period}[t-n]? 

{Punctuation[s] is[x] a clue to sentence patterns}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] also a source of errors for many English learners}[t-n]. {(The solution)[s] is[x] attention to sentence patterns}[t-n] {whenever you read and write}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[v] time (to understand)[inf]}[t-n], but[j] eventually[l] {it[s] will[x] become[v] a useful habit}[t-n].

## Seven Sentence Patterns

# SVO.

{(One subject)[s] goes[v] with one verb and one object}[t-n] {in the basic SVO pattern}[e-p].

{(The picture above)[s] is[x] from a Mexican celebration}[t-p]. {It[s] was[x] taken[v] in 2018}[t-p].

# SVO, plus SVO.

{(One of the FANBOYS)[s] connects[v] two SVO sentences}[t-n].  

{(Lots of people)[s] were[x] standing[v] together}[t-p], and[j] {(none of them)[s] were[x] wearing[v] masks}[t-p]. {Musicians[s] provided[v] live music}[t-p], and[j] {people[s] talked[v] to each other}[t-p]. {This[s] was[x] before the pandemic}[t-p], so {(most of us)[s] probably knew[v] very little about coronaviruses}[t-p]. {We[s] had[x] no clue how a tiny virus would[x] change[v] our lives}[t-p], but[j] {we[s] would[x] soon learn[v]}[t-p].

# SVO plus VO. 

{(This pattern)[s] uses[v] one subject with two or more verbs}[t-n], {connected by FANBOYS}[extra].

{(The celebration)[s] comes[v] from Oaxaca and is[x] called[v] Guelaguetza}[t-n]. {(Many adults and children)[s] wore[v] traditional clothes and seemed[v] happy}[t-p]. {(Some women)[s] wore[v] white lace and carried[v] bowls of colorful flags}[t-p]. {(Some men)[s] were[x] dressed[v] all in white and had[v] big hats}[t-p]. 

# Shifter, SVO. 

{(A shifter)[s] tells[v] you time, place, reason, contrast or condition}[t-n]. {(Shifters longer than three words)[s] use[v] a comma after at the end}[t-n]. Sometimes[l] {(a shifter)[s] looks[v] like a complete sentence}[t-n] {because it has[v] SVO}[e-r]. However[l], {(words like when, under, because, if and more)[s] are[x] clues indicating a shifter}[t-n] - {a dependent clause, not a complete sentence}[extra].

{Under the trees}[f-p], {performers[s] waited[v] in the shade}[t-p]. {When it was[x] their turn}[f-t], {they[s] walked[v] onstage}[t-p].

# SVO shifter.

{(This pattern)[s] is[x] the same as the one above it}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] starts[v] with the SVO}[t-n]. {There[s] is[x] no comma}[t-n] {before the shifter}[e-t].

{Performers[s] waited[v] in the shade}[t-p] {under the trees}[e-p]. {They[s] walked[v] onstage}[t-p] {when it was[x] their turn}[e-t].

# Linker, SVO. 

{Linkers[s] are[x] transition phrases and words like however, thus, moreover and more}[t-n]. {There[s] is[x] only one example below}[t-n] {because (one linker)[s] is[x] enough}[e-r].

Fortunately[l], {(the weather)[s] was[x] comfortable}[t-p].

# S, insert, VO. or SVO, insert. 

{Inserts[s] are[x] extra information set apart by commas, colons, dashes or parentheses}[t-n]. {(Understanding them)[s] helps[v] with reading as well as writing}[t-n].

{It[s] was[x] a beautiful day (to be)[inf] in the park}[t-p], {enjoying Guelaguetza}[extra]. {(My friend)[s], (a New Yorker from Mexico)[extra], complained[v] about families that (don't)[x] honor[v] traditional culture like that}[t-p]. {He[s] noticed[v] some young people around us looking bored}[t-p], {perhaps even ashamed}[extra]. {They[s] should[x] be[v] proud of their pre-colonial heritage}[t-n], {with its rich history and culture}[extra].
