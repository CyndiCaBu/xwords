{One winter Saturday}[f-t], {(the sun)[s] was[x] shining[v]}[t-p], but[j] {(the temperature)[s] was[x] only about 20 degrees Fahrenheit}[t-p], {minus 7 Celsius}[extra]. {(The combination of such cold air and strong winds)[s] led[vxd] to a wind chill advisory from the United States National Weather Service}[t-p]. {They[s] warned[vxd] of the danger of frostbite and hypothermia}[t-p], {advising[ger] people (to dress)[inf] in layers, keep[v] their hands and heads covered, and limit[v] their time outside (to protect)[inf] against frostbite}[extra]. 

{(Erik Hoversten)[s] was[x] following[v] this advice with a sign about the cold air and the NYC Compost Project}[t-p]. {He[s] was[x] accepting[v] food scraps}[t-p] {at the Sunnyside Greenmarket in Queens}[f-p]. {People[s] dropped[vxd] off unwanted parts of fruit and vegetables}[t-p], {as well as egg shells, coffee grounds and more}[extra]. {In the trash}[f-p], {(that kind of food waste)[s] gets[vxs] mixed with layers of plastic and all kinds of other waste}[t-n]. {It[s] (doesn't)[x] get[v] a chance (to be)[inf] reused as fertilizer nourishing[ger] the soil}[t-n-nq]. {In a compost pile}[f-p], {on the other hand}[l], {(oxygen, water and other organic matter)[s] combine[v] with food scraps (to decompose)[inf] in a healthy way}[t-n]. {Over time}[f-t], {(composted food scraps)[s] turn[vxo] into what some call black or brown gold}[t-n], {meaning valuable compost}[extra].

{On that freezing[ger] cold day}[f-t], {I[s] almost stayed[vxd] home}[t-p] {instead of walking[ger] to the  compost drop off}[e-ct]. {(The wind)[s] was[x] painful}[t-p] {as it hit my skin}[e-t]. However[l], {I[s] was[x] dressed[dtn] in layers}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] had[vxd] a lot of food scraps (to contribute)[inf]}[t-p]. {(Knowing[ger] that I would[x] get[v] finished compost back later)[s] helped[vxd] motivate me (to participate)[inf]}[t-p]. 

{Although composting takes more work than just throwing[ger] everything in the trash}[f-ct], {it[s] (is)[x] absolutely worth the effort}[t-n]. {(Healthier food)[s] depends[vxs] on healthier soil}[t-n], and[j] {compost[s] plays[vxs] a role in this}[t-n]. {It[s] can[x] also help[v] reduce waste, support[v] street trees and change[v] attitudes}[t-n]. {(Seeing food scraps as future fertilizer)[s], (not trash)[extra], could[x] help[v] people think about what other opportunities they might[x] be[v] missing}[t-n].
