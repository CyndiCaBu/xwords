{One winter Saturday}[f-t], {(the sun)[s] was[x] shining[vg]}[t-p], but[j] {(the temperature)[s] was[x] only about 20 degrees Fahrenheit}[t-p], {minus 7 Celsius}[extra]. {(The combination of such cold air and strong winds)[s] led[vxd] to a wind chill advisory from the United States National Weather Service}[t-p]. {They[s] warned[vxd] of the danger of frostbite and hypothermia}[t-p], {advising[ger] people (to limit)[inf] their time outside}[extra]. {If you are[x] heading[vg] outdoors in that kind of weather}[f-cd], {you[s] should[x] dress[v] in layers and keep[v] your hands and head covered (to protect)[inf] against frostbite}[t-n].

{(Erik Hoversten)[s] was[x] following[vg] this advice for the most part}[t-p], {but not 100 per cent}[extra]. {He[s] was[x] working[vg] at the Sunnyside Greenmarket in Queens}[t-p], {accepting[ger] food scraps as part of the NYC Compost Project}[extra]. {He[s] had[x] already spent[dtn] about 4 hours outside}[t-p] {by the time I saw him}[e-t].
 
{Erik[s] had[vxd] a sign saying[ger], "I braved the cold for NYC Compost Project"}[t-p]. {It[s] also mentioned[vxd] the idea of giving[ger] back}[t-p], {which is[x] central to the project}[extra]. {(People who understand the value of compost for healthy soil and plants)[s] make[vxo] the effort (to drop)[inf] off their compostable materials}[t-n]. {It[s]('s)[x] more work than just throwing[ger] everything in the trash}[t-n], but[j] {it[s]('s)[x] worth it}[t-n]. 

{In the trash}[f-p], {(food scraps)[s] get[vxo] mixed with layers of plastic and all kinds of stuff}[t-n], so[j] {they[s] (don't)[x] always get[v] a chance (to nourish)[inf] the soil}[t-n-nq]. {In a compost pile}[f-p], {on the other hand}[l], {(food scraps)[s] decompose[vxo] along with other organic matter}[t-n]. {Over time}[f-t], {it[s] all turns[vxs] into what some call black or brown gold}[t-n]. {That[s]('s)[x] what the NYC Compost Project gives back to the community}[t-n], {offering people a valuable source of fertilizer produced from their food scraps}[extra].

{On that freezing[ger] cold day}[f-t], {I[s] almost stayed[vxd] home}[t-p] {instead of going[ger] to the  compost drop off}[e-ct]. {On the way there}[f-p], {(the wind)[s] was[x] painful}[t-p] {as it hit my skin}[e-t]. However[l], {I[s] was[x] dressed[dtn] in layers}[t-p], and[j] {I[s] had[vxd] a lot of food scraps (to contribute)[inf]}[t-p]. {(Knowing[ger] that I would[x] get finished compost back later)[s] helped[vxd] motivate me (to participate)[inf]}[t-p]. {(Black gold)[s] is[x] a wonderful reward}[t-n].
