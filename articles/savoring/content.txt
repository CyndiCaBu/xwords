Savoring means more than just tasting or smelling something. In positive psychology, paying attention to our positive experiences, appreciating them and enhancing them is all part of savoring. It&#8216;s a process of slowing down to notice what&#8216;s around us and how we feel, considering all 5 senses.
We can savor positive experiences that happened in the past by remembering them and appreciating them again. We can also savor the present moment, by taking the time to appreciate whatever is positive in what we&#8216;re experiencing right here, right now. Savoring the future can happen when we look forward to an experience that we expect to be positive.
There are at least 10 different strategies that can help us savor what&#8216;s good in our daily lives. One is sharing positive experiences with others. One person might not notice something pleasant until someone else points it out. For instance, the first time Fernando Montoya got off the 7 train at the new 34th Street station, he didn&#8217;t notice the ceiling right away. He was just focused on getting out of the station and heading for the Highline. When his friend started commenting on how interesting the mosaic design was, Fernando looked up and pretended to be shocked. His friend laughed and took his picture. By laughing together and sharing the expression of wonder and appreciation, both people felt positive emotions. This was all part of savoring their experience.
Here are some other ways to practice savoring:
Sharpen your senses (taste, touch, sight, sound, smell). Focus on certain stimuli and block out others.
Immerse yourself in the moment. Let yourself experience absorption.
Take clear mental photographs. What do you need to notice now to help you remember this moment later? Think about how you would share this experience with others. What would you tell them?
