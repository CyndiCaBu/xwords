{We[s] can[x] savor[v] positive experiences that happened in the past}[t] {by remembering them and appreciating them again.}[e-r] {We[s] can[x] also savor[v] the present moment}[t] {by taking the time (to appreciate)[inf] whatever is[x] positive in what we('re)[x] experiencing right here, right now.}[e-r] {(Savoring the future)[s] can[x] happen[v]}[t] {when we look forward to an experience that we expect to be positive.}[e-t]
