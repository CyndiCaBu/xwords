{Thanks to some grants and the help of many hardworking volunteers}[f-r], {(New York City)[s] is[x] getting[g] greener}[t-p]. {There[s] are[x] many plants growing around street trees}[t-n]. {Most[s] are[x] perennials}[t-n], {which means that they(’ll)[x] come back every year}[extra].

{Why did[x] people[s] add[v] plants to places meant for trees}[t-p-nq]? {They[s] were[x] trying[g] (to follow)[inf] one clear rule}[t-p]: {no bare soil}[extra]!

{It[s] is[x] important (to keep)[inf] the ground covered at all times}[t-n]. {That[s] can[x] mean[v] covering it with plants that we enjoy looking at}[t-n], {such as flowers}[extra]. {It[s] also means[vxs] using plants that help nourish the soil}[t-n]. {(Lentils and peas)[s], (for instance)[extra], help[vxo] build nitrogen underground}[t-n]. {(Some types of radish)[s] help[vxo] reduce soil compaction}[t-n], (a problem in urban areas)[extra]. {People[s] often walk[vxo] right over the soil}[t-n] {without realizing they('re)[x] squashing it}[e-r].

{Plants[s] help[vxo] capture carbon in the soil}[t-n](;)[j] {they[s]('re)[x] a valuable tool in reducing climate change}[t-n]. {They[s] can[x] also brighten[v] an industrial area and encourage[v] people (to take)[inf] care of street trees by watering them}[t-n].


{If it('s)[x] too cold (to plant)[inf] plants}[f-cd], {(compost and mulch)[s] can[x] cover[v] the soil and help[v] nourish it for spring}[t=][t-n]. {Do[x] you[s] know[v] how cold is[x] too cold}[t-n-nq]? {It[s] depends[vxs] on the plants and the soil}[t-n], but[j] {(many plants)[s] do[vxo] well}[t-n] {if they get started in the cooler temperatures of fall}[e-cd]. {(Their roots)[s] have[vxo] a chance (to start)[inf] growing and getting used to their new location}[t-n] {before the real growth period in spring and summer}[e-t].

{In a city as big and complex as New York}[f-p], {it[s] makes[vxs] sense for people (to help)[inf] take care of the trees}[t-n]. {While many (aren’t)[x] interested in that at all}[f-ct], {others[s] are[x] really happy}[t-n] {when they find out they can[x] help[v]}[e-t]. {By watering trees, removing weeds, planting perennials, and adding mulch and compost}[f-r], {you[s] can[x] treat[v] a tree pit like your own tiny garden}[t-n]. However[l], {you[s] need[vxo] (to remember)[inf] that it('s)[x] a public space}[t-n]. {(New York City law)[s] says[vxs] that anything you put in a tree pit becomes property of the city}[t-n] - {even plants you bought with your own money}[extra]. 

{{The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn] in Novia Scotia, Canada}[t-p], {near the St. Croix River}[extra]. {(The sign)[s] shows[vxs] the way to a different Brooklyn}[t-n], far from Brooklyn, New York}[extra]. {Can[x] you[s] imagine[v] all 5 boroughs of New York City as green as this}[t-n-nq]?
