{Thanks to special programs, grants and the help of many hardworking volunteers}[f-r], {(New York City)[s] is[x] getting[v] greener}[t-p]. {(More trees)[s] are[x] growing[v]}[t-n] {in bigger, more appropriate tree pits on the sidewalks}[e-p]. {Many[s] share[vxo] the soil with other plants growing[ger] around them}[t-n], {including perennials}[extra]. {Growing[ger] year after year}[f-t], {(these plants)[s] can[x] join[v] trees in restoring our soil and atmosphere}[t-n], {slowing[ger] down climate change and protecting[ger] biodiversity}[extra]. 

{Without efforts (to keep)[inf] the city green and biodiverse}[f-r], {(New York)[s] will[x] be[v] in serious trouble}[t-n] {within a few decades}[e-t]. {It[s]('s)[x] surrounded by water that will[x] flood[v] most of the city if climate change keeps melting glaciers}[t-n]. {(A few rules)[s] can[x] guide[v] New York and other cities towards a better future}[t-n]. {Who[s]('s)[x] ready (to follow)[inf] them}[t-n-nq]?

# Keep it covered

{(The soil)[s] needs[vxs] (to be)[inf] covered at all times}[t-n] - {with plants and trees, not concrete, garbage, dog pee or other signs of disrespect or ignorance}[extra]. {(Soil[s] needs[vxs] living roots}[t-n], {finding their nutrients in it and nourishing it with what they give}[extra]. {For instance}[l], {(lentils and peas)[s] help[vxo] build nitrogen underground}[t-n]. {(Most plants and trees)[s] catch[vxo] carbon}[t-n], {adding[ger] it to the soil and reducing[ger] it in our atmosphere}[e-r].

# Keep roots alive

{If it('s)[x] too cold (to plant)[inf] plants}[f-cd], {(compost and mulch)[s] can[x] cover[v] the soil}[t-n], {slowly adding nutrients to be used in the spring}[extra]. {(How cold)[s] is[x] too cold}[t-n-nq]? {It[s] depends[vxs] on the plants and the soil}[t-n], but[j] {(many plants)[s] do[vxo] well}[t-n] {if they get started in the cooler temperatures of fall}[e-cd] - {as plants, not seeds}[extra]. {(Their roots)[s] have[vxo] a chance (to start)[inf] growing[ger] and adjusting[ger] to their new conditions}[t-n] {before their real growth period in spring and summer}[e-t].

# Walk well

{(People and plants)[s] can[x] work[v] together to reduce soil compaction}[t-n], (a problem in urban areas)[extra]. {People[s] often walk[vxo] right over the soil}[t-n] {without realizing[ger] they('re)[x] squashing[vg] it}[e-r]. {What[s]('s)[x] wrong with that}[t-n-nq]? {(Water and air)[s] have[vxo] trouble getting in and out of the soil in a healthy way}[t-n], {leading to potential problems for trees and plants, including diseases}[extra]. {When flowers are[x] blooming[v] and plants are[x] growing[v] in the soil}[f-cd], {(most people)[s] react[vxo] better}[t-n]. {They[s] are[x] more likely (to keep)[inf] their feet and their dogs where they belong}[t-n], {on the sidewalk, not the soil}[extra]. 

# Increase diversity

{Biodiversity[s] means[vxs] different types of living organisms}[t-n]. {What[s] would[x] happen[v]}[t-n-nq] {if a block or a neighborhood had only one type of tree, one that got infected by a beetle, fungus or other problem}[e-cd]? {(Different types of trees and plants)[s] are[x] healthier}[t-n]. {They[s] also attract[vxo] more diverse insects}[t-n], {such as butterflies}[extra].

# Participate

{In a city as big and complex as New York}[f-p], {it[s] makes[vxs] sense for people (to help)[inf] take care of the environment}[t-n]. {While many (arenâ€™t)[x] interested in that at all}[f-ct], {others[s] are[x] really happy}[t-n] {when they find out they can[x] help[v]}[e-t]. {By watering[ger] trees, removing[ger] weeds, planting[ger] perennials, and adding[ger] mulch and compost}[f-r], {they[s] can[x] treat[v] a tree pit like their own tiny garden}[t-n]. {That[s] can[x] lead[v] to a sense of pride and responsibility}[t-n], {an understanding that the city and its beauty belongs to all of us}[extra]. {Since tree pits are[x] public spaces}[f-r], {(anything people put in them)[s] becomes[vxs] property of the city}[t-n] - {even plants people bought with their own money}[extra].

# Be optimistic

{(The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn] in Novia Scotia, Canada}[t-p], {near the St. Croix River}[extra]. {(The sign)[s] shows[vxs] the way to a different Brooklyn}[t-n], {far from Brooklyn, New York}[extra]. {Can[x] you[s] imagine[v] all 5 boroughs of New York City as green as this}[t-n-nq]? {Are[x] you[s] ready (to help)[inf] try}[t-n-nq]?
