{(A mindset)[s] is[x] a way of thinking[ger]}[t-n], {especially a way that('s)[x] a habit}[extra]. {We[s] might[x] see[v] ourselves as good at one subject but not another}[t-n-nq]. {(Some people)[s] say[vxo] they('re)[x] good at sports}[t-n], while[j] {others[s] claim[vxo] they[s] (can't)[x] even throw a ball straight}[t-n]. {Is[x] this[s] really about ability}[t-n-nq], or[j] {could[x] it[s] be[v] about something else}[t-n-nq] - {like our mindset}[extra]?

{According to Carol Dweck}[l], {a researcher who studies motivation}[extra], {(our mindset)[s] can[x] influence[v] how well we do things}[t-n]. {With a growth mindset}[f-r], {we[s] make[vxo] the effort (to learn)[inf] what we want (to learn)[inf]}[t-n]. {We[s] (don’t)[x] let[v] obstacles stop us}[t-n](;)[j] {we[s] get[vxo] help and spend[vxo] time and energy practicing[ger]}[t=n]. {If we fail}[f-cd], {we[s] find[vxo] out why}[t-n], and[j] {we[s] do[vxo] something (to improve)[inf]}[t-n]. {On the contrary}[l], {(a fixed mindset)[s] makes[vxs] us give up easily}[t-n], {thinking[ger] that trouble doing[ger] something now means we (won’t)[x] be able (to do)[inf] it later either}[extra]. 

{(Jarvis Johnson)[s] is[x] a software engineer and engineering manager who used (to have)[inf] a fixed mindset}[t-n]. {In his YouTube video (Why I'm Bad at Math)[title]}[f-p], {he[s] describes[vxs] how he did[x] very well in school}[t-n] {when it was[x] easy for him}[e-t]. {Unfortunately}[l], {he[s] (didn't)[x] learn[v] good study habits}[t-p] {because he (didn't)[x] need to}[e-r]. {In junior high}[f-p], {he[s] spent[vxd] his free time playing[ger] video games with his friends}[t-p] -- {not doing[ger] homework}[extra]. {(The consequences)[s] finally came[vxd]}[t-p] {when he failed algebra}[e-t] - {a subject that didn't come naturally to him}[extra]. {(His parents)[s] made[vxd] it clear that was[x] unacceptable}[t-p]. {The following year}[f-t], {he[s] improved[vxd] somewhat}[t-p], {changing[ger] his behavior and passing[ger] the class}[extra]. {However}[l], {he[s] learned[vxd] the wrong lesson}[t-p]. {Instead of realizing[ger] that hard work and practice made him do better in math}[f-ct], {he[s] decided[vxd] that he wasn't good at it}[t-p].

{(A growth mindset)[s] is[x] much more useful}[t-n]. {(Two simple words)[s] can[x] help us choose it}[t-n], {as Dweck explains}[extra]. {Rather than say we (can't)[x] do something}[f-ct], {we[s] can[x] say[v] "Not yet"}[t-n] {if it('s)[x] something we want (to learn)[inf]}[e-cd].  {Do[x] you[s] know[v] all the elements on the periodic table}[t-n-nq]? {Do[x] you[s] understand[v] the difference between abstract art and figurative art}[t-n-nq]? {Can[x] you[s] write[v] a 10-page research paper in English}[t-n-nq]? {If you want (to learn)[inf] any of that}[f-cd], {you[s] can}[t-n]. {Depending[ger] on how much you already know}[f-cd], {you[s] may[x] need[v] (to study)[inf] a lot on your own and/or get help from others}[t-n-nq], so[j] {you[s] will[x] need[v] (to stay)[inf] motivated}[t-n]. {(Believing[ger] that you actually can[x] learn and get better at something)[s] will[x] encourage[v] you (to work)[inf] hard and keep practicing[ger]}[t-n].
