A mindset is a way of thinking, especially a way that&#8216;s a habit. It&#8216;s a mentality, such as being open-minded or narrow-minded.
Thinking about mindset in terms of education can make a difference in how well we learn. For instance, do you have certain ideas about your own abilities? Have you ever said you&#8216;re good at one subject but not another? Some people say they&#8216;re good at math but not at languages, or vice versa. Yet are they right? What makes them better at math than at language learning? Is it a question of intelligence, or perhaps talent? What&#8216;s the difference between talent and intelligence anyway?
According to Carol Dweck, a researcher who studies motivation, successful learners see intelligence as potential. It&#8216;s something that they can develop. In her book Mindset, she describes different ways people respond to difficulties when learning.
Some people are used to doing well in school, but when they suddenly find a subject difficult, they almost give up. That could be due to a fixed mindset, a belief that they&#8216;re just not good at that subject. Because of that belief, they don&#8217;t try as hard as they should.
Other people respond to a challenge by struggling. They make an extra effort to deal with the hard subject by studying more, getting help from others, or doing whatever they have to do in order to learn. Instead of thinking it&#8216;s not for them, they work hard to make it for them by trying to learn. That&#8216;s a growth mindset, believing that you can learn and get better at something. Instead of wasting time doubting themselves, people with a growth mindset put in the time and effort to make progress.
A growth mindset comes naturally to us when we&#8216;re children. We don&#8217;t even realize it at the time, but we spend our early years facing and overcoming all kinds of obstacles. Our whole job is to learn and grow, and if we&#8216;re lucky, we enjoy a lot of love and fun in the process. Going down a slide might be scary at the top and briefly painful if you bump the ground too hard at the bottom, but we do it anyway because it&#8216;s fun. That teaches us that we can do it, which makes us try again. The more we remember our past success to get over our present fear, the more we can learn and grow.
Two simple words can help us develop a growth mindset. Instead of telling ourselves that we can&#8217;t do something, it helps to say &#8220;Not yet.&#8221; Maybe you can&#8217;t do it yet, but if you try, you will do it later. If you really want to, you can learn how to do it well, whatever it is.
You can learn more about growth and fixed mindset by looking for Carol Dweck on YouTube and other platforms, including her books.
