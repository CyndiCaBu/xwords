{(Governors Island)[s] is[x] a small island in New York Harbor,}[t] (very close to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island.)[extra] {It[s] was[x] inhabited[dtn] by American Indians of the Lenape tribe first and later by various European groups after the Dutch arrived there in the 1620s.}[t] (For a while,)[l] {it[s] was[x] used[dtn] by the British,}[t] (who gave it[s] the name we use today.)[extra] {They[s] planned[vxd] (to use)[inf] the island for their royal governors.}[t]

{During the American Revolution,}[f] {New York was[x] occupied[dtn] by the British.}[t] {(George Washington and his army)[s] had[x] tried[dtn] (to capture)[inf] Governors Island for the colonists,}[t] the people resisting England. (Nevertheless,)[l] {(the British)[s] won that particular battle.}[t] {They[s] occupied[vxd] some of the forts that were[x] built (to protect)[inf] the coastline.}[t] {Fighting[s] continued[vxd].}[t] Eventually[l], {(the British)[s] surrendered[vxd]}[t] {in 1783.}[e]


{(Some of the forts)[s] were[x] renovated[dtn]}[t] (after the war,)[e] (including two buildings  that you can[x] visit if you go to the island nowadays[l].)[extra] {One[s] is[x] called[dtn] Fort Jay,}[t] and[j] {(the other)[s] is[x] known as Castle Williams,}[t] (due to its shape and style.)[extra] {(The National Park Service)[s] offers[vxs] tours of the latter.)}[t] {If it[s](’s)[x] not too crowded,}[f] {you[s] can[x] walk[v] around the exhibits on the ground level by yourself.}[t]  {(Castle Williams)[s] closes[vxs] a little earlier than the rest of the island,}[t] so[j] {you[s] should[x] plan[v] accordingly.}[t]


{(Fort Jay)[s] is[x] near the Brooklyn side of Governors Island;}[t] {you[s] can[x] walk[v] around it by yourself.}[t] {Like Castle Williams,}[l] {it[s] gives[vxs] you[s] a sense of the history of the island and the way wars have[x] changed over the centuries, without losing any of their horror.}[t] {There[s] are[x] a few cannons}[t] {at various positions around Fort Jay and some cannonballs,}[e] (too.)[extra] {They[s] (don’t)[x] look[v] like they’re the right size for the cannons,}[t] but[j] {they[s] still help[v] you imagine how awful it would[x] be (to fight)[inf] with them}[t]  (-- or against them.)[extra]


{No matter what side you(’re)[x] on,}[f] {war[s] involves[vxs] suffering.}[t] {At Governors Island nowadays,}[f] {you[s] could[x] understand[v] that by trying (to visualize)[inf] the island's history.}[t]  (On the other hand,)[l] {you[s] could[x] spend[v] your day there enjoying all the trees and open space.}[t] {It[s]’s up to you!}[t]
