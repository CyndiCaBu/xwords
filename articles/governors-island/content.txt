{(Governors Island)[s] is[x] a small island in New York Harbor}[t-n], {very close to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island}[extra]. {It[s] was[x] inhabited[dtn] by American Indians of the Lenape tribe}[t-p] {first}[e-t]. {After the Dutch arrived there in the 1620s}[f-t], {(they and other European groups)[s] lived[vxd] on the island}[t-p]. 

{(The British)[s] gave it the name we use today}[t-p]. {They[s] planned[vxd] (to use)[inf] the island for their royal governors}[t-p], but[j] {(the colonists)[s] had[vxd] a different idea}[t-p]. {(The colonists)[s] were[x] people who had come from England}[t-p] {seeking religious freedom}[extra]. {They[s] were[x] trying[v] (to get)[inf] away from British control}[t-p], so[j] {when the British occupied New York}[f-t], {including Governors Island}[extra], {they[s] resisted[vxd]}[t-p]. 

{(Visiting the island now)[s] can[x] give[x] you a sense of its history}[t-n]. {There[s] are[x] a few cannons and some cannonballs}[t-n] {at various positions on the island}[e-p].  {(Some of the cannonballs)[s] (don’t)[x] look[v] like they(’re)[x] the right size for the cannons}[t-n-nq], but[j] {they[s] still help[vxo] you imagine how awful it would[x] be (to fight)[inf] with them}[t-n]  {- or against them}[extra].

{(Governors Island)[s] is[x] open to visitors}[t-n] {on weekends during the warmer months}[e-t]. {Volunteers[s] can[x] visit[v] year-round}[t-n] {if they are part of a program that works on the island}[e-cd], {like the compost project at Earth Matter}[extra]. {(The island)[s] has[vxs] open spaces, special events and all kinds of ways to learn and enjoy yourself}[t-n]. {You[s] have[vxo] a better chance of seeing people from many different countries getting along well than seeing British and Americans fighting over territory}[t-n]. {(The chances of cannon fire on the island)[s] are[x] slim indeed}[t-n]!
