{(Governors Island)[s] is[x] a small island in New York Harbor,}[t] {very close to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island.}[extra] {It[s] was[x] inhabited[dtn] by American Indians of the Lenape tribe}[t] {first.}[l] {After the Dutch arrived there in the 1620s,}[f-t] {(they and other European groups)[s] lived[vxd] on the island.}[t]  (For a while,)[l] {it[s] was[x] used[dtn] by the British,}[t] (who gave it the name we use today.)[extra] {They[s] planned[vxd] (to use)[inf] the island for their royal governors.}[t]

{During the American Revolution,}[f-t] {(New York)[s] was[x] occupied[dtn] by the British.}[t] {(George Washington and his army)[s] had[x] tried[dtn] (to capture)[inf] Governors Island for the colonists,}[t] {the people resisting England.}[extra] (Nevertheless,)[l] {(the British)[s] won[vxd] that particular battle.}[t] {They[s] occupied[vxd] some of the forts that were[x] built (to protect)[inf] the coastline.}[t] {Fighting[s] continued[vxd].}[t] Eventually[l], {(the British)[s] surrendered[vxd]}[t] {in 1783.}[e-t]

{(Some of the forts)[s] were[x] renovated[dtn]}[t] {after the war,}[e-t] {including two buildings that you can[x] visit nowadays[l].}[extra] {One[s] is[x] called[dtn] Fort Jay,}[t] and[j] {(the other)[s] is[x] known[dtn] as Castle Williams,}[t] {due to its shape and style.}[extra] {(The National Park Service)[s] offers[vxs] tours of the latter.}[t] {If it[s](’s)[x] not too crowded,}[f-cd] {you[s] can[x] walk[v] around the exhibits on the ground level by yourself.}[t]  {(Castle Williams)[s] closes[vxs] a little earlier than the rest of the island,}[t] so[j] {you[s] should[x] plan[v] accordingly.}[t]

{(Fort Jay)[s] is[x] near the Brooklyn side of Governors Island;}[t] {you[s] can[x] walk[v] around it by yourself.}[t] {Like Castle Williams,}[l] {it[s] gives[vxs] you a sense of the history of the island and the way wars have[x] changed over the centuries}[t], {without losing any of their horror.}[extra] {There[s] are[x] a few cannons}[t] {at various positions around Fort Jay}[e-p], {and some cannonballs, too.}[extra] {They[s] (don’t)[x] look[v] like they(’re)[x] the right size for the cannons,}[t] but[j] {they[s] still help[v] you imagine how awful it would[x] be (to fight)[inf] with them}[t]  (-- or against them.)[extra]

{No matter what side you(’re)[x] on,}[f] {war[s] involves[vxs] suffering.}[t] {At Governors Island}[f-p] {nowadays}[f-t], {you[s] could[x] try[v] (to understand)[inf] that suffering by visualizing the island's history.}[t]  (On the other hand,)[l] {you[s] could[x] ignore[v] the clues to the past and spend[v] your day there enjoying all the trees and open space.}[t] {It[s](’s)[x] up to you!}[t]
