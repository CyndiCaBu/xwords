{One afternoon}[f] {I[s] went[vxd] to a restaurant for lunch with some friends.}[t] {(The sky)[s] had[x] been[dtn] gray all day,}[t] so {I[s] took[vxd] an umbrella with me}[t] {just in case.}[e] {I[s] forgot[vxd] all about the weather}[t] {while we[s] were[x] eating,}[e] but[j] {as soon as we[s] left the restaurant,}[f] {it[s] started[vxd] snowing hard.}[t]

{I[s] used[vxd] my umbrella for half a block and then went[vxd] into a store.}[t=] Unfortunately[l], {(an employee at the front door)[s] asked[vxd] me (to leave)[inf] it in a bucket full of other umbrellas,}[t] so[j] {I[s] did[vxd].}[t] 

{It[s] (didn’t)[x] take me long (to do)[inf] my shopping,}[t] but[j] {by the time I was[x] ready (to leave)[inf],}[f] {(my umbrella)[s] was[x] gone[dtn].}[t] {There[s] were[x] no more customers in the store,}[t] and[j] {although the employee at the door tried (to help)[inf],}[f] {there[s] was[x] nothing either of us could[x] do.}[t] (At least)[l] {it[s] (wasn’t)[x] snowing[v] very hard anymore}[t] {when I left.}[e] {(Whoever stole my umbrella)[s] probably (wasn’t)[x] too thrilled}[t] {when he or she noticed that it had[x] a few stains and several tiny holes.}[e]

{I[s] was[x] annoyed[dtn] at the thief,}[t] but[j] {I[s] also learned[vxd] not (to make)[inf] that mistake again.}[t] {Next time}[f] {I[s](’ll)[x] take[v] an umbrella case or a plastic bag with me and politely refuse[v]}[t=] {if someone asks me (to leave)[inf] my umbrella at the door.}[e]
