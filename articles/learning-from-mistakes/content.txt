{One winter afternoon}[f-t], {I[s] went[vxd] to a restaurant for lunch with some friends}[t-p]. {(The sky)[s] had[x] been[dtn] gray all day}[t-p], so {I[s] took[vxd] an umbrella with me}[t-p] {just in case}[e-r]. {I[s] forgot[vxd] all about the weather}[t-p] {while we[s] were[x] eating}[e-t]. {As soon as we[s] left the restaurant}[f-t], {we[s] found[vxd] out it was already snowing hard}[t-p].

{(My friends)[s] hurried[vxd] (to catch)[inf] the train and get home}[t-p] {before the weather got worse}[e-t]. {We[s] were[x]}[t-p] {in my neighborhood}[e-p], so {I[s] started[vxd] walking home}[t-p]. {I[s] used[vxd] my umbrella for half a block}[t-p] {because the snow was[x] wet}[e-r]. 

{When I stopped[vxd] at a store}[f-t], {I ran[vxd] into some minor bad luck}[t-p]. {(An employee at the front door)[s] asked[vxd] me (to leave)[inf] my umbrella in a bucket full of other umbrellas}[t-p], so[j] {I[s] did[vxd]}[t-p]. {It[s] (didn’t)[x] take me long (to do)[inf] my shopping}[t-p], but[j] {by the time I was[x] ready (to leave)[inf]}[f-t], {(my umbrella)[s] was[x] gone[dtn]}[t-p]. {There[s] were[x] no more customers in the store and no umbrellas left in the bucket}[t-p]. {Although the employee at the door tried (to help)[inf]}[f-ct], {there[s] was[x] nothing either of us could[x] do}[t-p]. {At least}[l] {it[s] (wasn’t)[x] snowing[v] very hard anymore}[t-p] {when I left the store}[e-t]. {(Whoever stole my umbrella)[s] probably (wasn’t)[x] too thrilled}[t] {when he or she noticed that it had[x] a few stains and several tiny holes}[e-t].

{I[s] was[x] annoyed[dtn] at the thief}[t-p], but[j] {I[s] also learned[vxd] not (to make)[inf] that mistake again}[t-p]. {Next time}[f-t] {I[s](’ll)[x] take[v] an umbrella case or a plastic bag with me and politely refuse[v]}[t=] {if someone asks me (to leave)[inf] my umbrella at the door}[e-cd]. {If they argue}[f-cd], {I[s](’ll)[x] take[v] my business elsewhere}[t-n]. {(Treating umbrellas as disposable items)[s] is[s] wrong}[t-n] - {like stealing them}[extra].
