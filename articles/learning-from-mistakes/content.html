One afternoon I went out to a restaurant for lunch. The sky had been gray all day, so I took an umbrella with me just in case. I forgot all about the weather while I was eating, but as soon as I left the restaurant it started raining hard.
I opened my umbrella for half a block and then went in a store. Unfortunately, when an employee at the front door asked me to leave my umbrella in a bucket full of other umbrellas, I agreed. Since I wasn’t in a hurry, I took my time to fold the umbrella neatly and wrap its little strap around it, snapping it closed before placing it in the bucket.
It didn’t take me long to do my shopping, but by the time I was ready to leave, my umbrella was gone. There were no more customers in the store, and although the employee at the door tried to help, there was nothing either of us could do. At least it wasn’t raining very hard anymore when I left. Whoever stole my umbrella probably wasn’t too thrilled when he or she noticed that it had a few stains and several tiny holes.
I was annoyed at the thief, but I also learned not to make that mistake again. Next time I’ll take an umbrella case or a plastic bag with me and politely refuse if someone asks me to leave my umbrella at the door.
