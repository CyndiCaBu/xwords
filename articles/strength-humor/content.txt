One funny thing about humor is that it&#8216;s universal, but also very cultural and even personal. Perhaps we all laugh in the same language, but you might laugh at things that make other people roll their eyes.
Although a joke usually isn&#8217;t very funny when you have to explain it, that&#8216;s not always true. Like so many things, it depends on the context. Some friends from Bosnia used to laugh whenever they were finishing a phone call with someone and that person said, “Thank you for calling.” To an American, that sounds perfectly natural, but they explained that it was hilarious to them. It just wasn&#8217;t something they were accustomed to. It seemed quite silly to express gratitude for a simple phone call.
Friends from Argentina had no problem enjoying sarcastic humor. On the other hand, friends from the Dominican Republic really didn&#8217;t appreciate it. Sarcasm can be a somewhat gentle push, like thanking your friend for coming early when he&#8216;s actually half an hour late. It can also be closer to an insult. In fact, a dictionary definition suggests bad intentions associated with sarcasm, like trying to hurt another person. However, people’s reactions to it depend on their overall relationship, as well as the tone.
