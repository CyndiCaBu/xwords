{(One funny thing about humor)[s] is[x] that it('s)[x] universal}[t-n], yet[j] {it[s]('s)[x] also both cultural and personal}[t-n]. {We[s] all laugh[vxo] in the same language}[t-n], {in our own ways}[extra]. However[l], {we[s] (don't)[x] all laugh[v] at the same things}[t-n-nq]. 

{Have[x] you[s] ever laughed[dtn] at something that made other people roll their eyes}[t-b]? {(The turtle in this photo)[s], (made from brownies with pieces of grapefruit and a tiny slice of tomato as decorations)[extra], is[x] sitting[v]}[t-n] {on a plate on the grass}[e-p]. {(That unusual sight)[s] would[x] make[v] some people at least smile}[t-n]. {In fact}[l], {(many different factors)[s] affect[vxo] what we find funny}[t-n], {including our mood}[extra]. 

{Have[x] you[s] ever found[dtn] yourself laughing while others remained serious}[t-b]?  {Humor[s] often depends[vxs] on the context}[t-n]. {For instance}[l], {(some friends from Bosnia)[s] used[vxd] (to laugh)[inf]}[t-p] {whenever someone said, “Thank you for calling” at the end of a phone call}[e-t]. {In English}[f-r], {that[s] sounds[vxs] perfectly natural}[t-n], but[j] {they[s] explained[vxd] that it was[x] hilarious to them}[t-p]. {(Expressing gratitude for a simple phone call)[s] seemed[vxd] quite silly}[t-p](;)[j] {they[s] (weren't)[x] accustomed to it yet}[t-p]. 

{Culture[s] clearly has[vxs] an influence on what makes people laugh}[t-n]. {(Other friends from Argentina)[s] had[vxd] no problem enjoying sarcastic humor}[t-p-nq]. {On the other hand}[l], {(friends from the Dominican Republic)[s] really (didn't)[x] appreciate[v] it}[t-p]. {It[s] seemed[vxd] too negative}[t-p], {like criticism}[extra].

{Sarcasm[s] can[x] be[v] a somewhat gentle push}[t-n], {like thanking your friend for coming early when he('s)[x] actually half an hour late}[extra]. {It[s] can[x] also be[v] closer to an insult}[t-n]. {In fact}[l], {(a dictionary definition)[s] suggests[vxs] bad intentions associated with sarcasm}[t-n], {like trying (to hurt)[inf] another person}[extra].
