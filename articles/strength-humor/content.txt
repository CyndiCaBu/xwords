{Humor[s] is[x] universal}[t-n], yet[j] {it[s] is[x] also both cultural and personal}[t-n]. {We[s] all laugh[vxo] in the same language}[t-n], {in our own ways}[extra]. However[l], {we[s] (don't)[x] all laugh[v] at the same things}[t-n-nq]. 

{Have[x] you[s] ever laughed[dtn] at something that made other people roll their eyes}[t-b]? {For instance}[l], {(the turtle in this photo)[s] made[vxd] one person smile}[t-p]. {(Another person)[s] complained[vxd] that it did[x] not belong[v] in the grass and it would[x] not taste[v] good}[t-p]. {Although the turtle was[x] made[dtn] from brownies}[f], {(the small pieces of grapefruit and tomato used for the eyes and nose)[s] would[x] change[v] the flavor}[t-p]. 

{Why did[x] (those 2 people)[s] react[v] differently to the brownie-turtle}[t-p-nq]? {Why (didn't)[x] they[s] both find[v] it funny}[t-p-nq]? {(Many factors)[s] affect[vxo] what amuses us}[t-n], {including our mood}[extra]. 

{(One factor)[s] is[x] culture}[t-n]. {For instance}[l], {(some friends from Bosnia)[s] used[vxd] (to laugh)[inf]}[t-p] {whenever someone said, “Thank you for calling[ger]” at the end of a phone call}[e-t]. {In English}[f-r], {that[s] sounds[vxs] perfectly natural}[t-n], but[j] {it[s] was[x] hilarious to them}[t-p]. {(Expressing[ger] gratitude for a simple phone call)[s] seemed[vxd] quite silly}[t-p](;)[j] {they[s] (weren't)[x] accustomed to it yet}[t-p]. 

{(Personal taste)[s] also has[vxs] an influence on what makes people laugh}[t-n]. {Those Bosnian friends}[s], {like friends from Argentina}[extra], {had[vxd] no problem enjoying[ger] sarcastic humor}[t-p-nq]. {On the other hand}[l], {(friends from the Dominican Republic)[s] really (didn't)[x] appreciate[v] sarcasm}[t-p]. {It[s] seemed[vxd] too negative to them}[t-p], {closer to an insult than to friendly teasing}[extra]. {Was[x] this[s] about culture, taste or both}[t-p-nq]?

{Consider the last thing that made you laugh}[t-n-nq]. {What kind of humor was[x] that}[t-n]?  {What could[x] make[v] you[s] laugh right now}[t-n-nq], {or at least giggle a bit}[extra]? {If humor is[x] one of your character strengths}[f], {amusement[s] could[x] be one of the positive emotions (to savor)[inf] in your everyday life}[t-n].
