{How much energy do[x] you use in the form of electricity}[t-n-nq]? {How is[x] that connected to making[ger] climate change worse or better}[t-n-nq]? {(Earth Hour)[s] is[x] an annual event that encourages people (to think)[inf] about these questions}[t-n].

{Around the world}[f-p], {people[s] turn[vxo] off all their lights, electronics and other appliances}[t-n] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[vxs] place at night and lasts[vxs] for one hour}[t=n], {as the name suggests}[extra]. {Instead of using[ger] electricity}[f-ct], {people[s] can[x] enjoy[v] the dark on their own or use[v] that time (to participate)[inf] in some kind of public gathering[ger]}[t-n]. {In many areas}[f-p], {events[s] are[x] organized[dtn] (to publicize)[inf] Earth Hour and get people talking[ger] about electricity}[t-n]. {How is[x] it[s] produced}[t-n-nq]? Wasted? Conserved?

{(Keeping all the lights on all night)[s] is[x] often a waste of energy}[t-n]. Obviously[l], {(some lights)[s] are[x] needed[dtn] for workers like housekeepers and security guards}[t-n], and[j] {(other lights)[s] can[x] warn[v] birds and planes of obstacles}[t-n]. {When buildings go almost totally dark during Earth Hour}[f-t], {electricity[s] is[x] conserved[dtn]}[t-n] - {but only briefly}[extra].

{(The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn]}[t-p] {in Queens, New York}[e-p] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {(Traffic lights)[s] were[x] kept[dtn] on}[t-p] {for obvious reasons}[e-r]. {(The Empire State Building)[s] was[x] almost totally dark}[t-p], so[j] {it[s] may[x] be[v] hard (to see)[inf]}[t-n-nq] {in this image}[e-p]. {(The top floors)[s] are[x] usually lit[dtn] up in different colors (to honor)[inf] holidays, sports events and more}[t-n].

{Is[x] (Earth Hour)[s] effective}[t-n-nq]? {(Turning[ger] things off for an hour once a year)[s] will[x] not do much (to slow)[inf] down climate change}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] is[x] a symbolic action}[t-n], {not a solution to the problem of how electricity is[x] generated and used}[extra]. {It[s] may[x] also contribute[v] to the problem}[t-n-nq].

{(Many photos related to Earth Hour)[s] are[x] posted[dtn] online}[t-n] {before and after it}[e-t]. {That[s] involves[vxs] electricity}[t-n]. {(Some images)[s] show[v] messages spelled out by a group of people holding[ger] many small candles}[t-n]. {That[s] might[x] look[v] pretty}[t-n-nq], but[j] {it[s] is[x] counter-productive}[t-n]. {Whenever anything is[x] burned[dtn]}[f-t], {carbon[s] is[x] released[dtn] into the atmosphere}[t-n]. {(Burning[ger] candles for Earth Hour)[s] makes[vxs] no sense}[t-n-nq].

{(Earth Hour)[s] could[x] become[v] more effective}[t-n] {by focusing[ger] on solutions}[e-r]. {(The amount of carbon in the atmosphere)[s] is[x] dangerously high}[t-n]. {If everyone (doesn't)[x] start changing[ger]}[f-cd], {(those carbon levels)[s] (won't)[x] go down enough (to slow)[inf] down climate change}[t-n-nq]. {What can[x] we[s] all do[v] (to help)[inf]}[t-n-nq]? {We[s] can[x] start[v] by turning off the lights and putting away all screens ten minutes earlier each night}[t-n], {gradually increasing that to 20 minutes and more}[extra]. {(The energy we can save that way)[s] may[x] not be[v] significant}[t-n], but[j] {if millions of people try this}[f-cd], {(the effect)[s] can[x] matter[v]}[t-n]. {(Other ideas)[s] are[x] (to eat)[inf] less meat, buy fewer new clothes, and eliminate food waste}[t-n]. {(That last step)[s] means[vxs] that we eat all the food we buy}[t-n], and[j] {we[s] compost[vxo] food scraps like orange peel, coffee grounds, etc.}[t-n]. 

{(Carbon)[s] is[x] not only in the air}[t-n-nq](;)[j] {it[s]('s)[x] also in the soil}[t-n]. {(Planting[ger] more plants and trees)[s] helps[vxs] trap more carbon underground}[t-n], {where soil microbes can[x] eat it}[extra]. {This[s] is[x] our responsibility}[t-n] - {even those of us without farms or gardens}[extra]. {In cities}[f-p], {we[s] can[x] take[v] care of street trees}[t-n] {by watering[ger] them and planting[ger] plants around them}[e-r]. {(Every patch of bare soil)[s] needs[vxs] something green growing[ger] on it}[t-n], {sucking[ger] carbon out of the atmosphere and into the soil}[extra]. {(Even houseplants)[s] can[x] help[v]}[t-n].
