{(Earth Hour)[s] is[x] celebrated[dtn]}[t] {around the world}[e] {every year.}[e] {It[s] is[x] meant[dtn] (to draw)[inf] attention to how much energy we use in the form of electricity and (to connect)[inf] that idea to climate change.}[t] {People[s] are[x] asked[dtn] (to turn)[inf] off all their lights, electronics and other appliances}[t] {for one hour}[e]. {Instead of using electricity,}[f] {they[s] can[v] enjoy[v] the dark or use[v] that time (to participate)[inf] in some kind of public gathering.}[t] {In many areas,}[f] {events[s] are[x] organized[dtn] (to publicize)[inf] Earth Hour and get people talking about electricity and how it[s] is[x] not only produced but[j] also both wasted and conserved.}[t]

{(The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn] in Queens, New York during Earth Hour.}[t] {(The Empire State Building)[s] is[x] usually lit[dtn] up in different colors,}[t] but[j] {here[f] it[s] is[x] almost totally dark.}[t] {It[s] may[x] be[v] hard (to see)[inf]}[t] {because most of the lights were[x] turned off,}[e] {although not all of them.}[extra] {(Traffic lights)[s] were[x] kept[dtn] on for obvious reasons.}[t]

{(The whole idea of Earth Hour)[s] is[x] criticized[dtn] by people who say turning things off for an hour once a year will[x] not do[x] much (to slow)[inf] down climate change.}[t] {It[s] is[x] a symbolic action,}[t] {not a solution to the problem of how electricity is[x] generated and used.}[extra] {(Many photos)[s] are[x] posted[dtn] online}[t] {before and after Earth Hour.}[e] {That[s] means[vxs] that electricity is[x] involved[dtn] after all.}[extra] {(Some images)[s] show[v] messages spelled out by a group of people holding many small candles.}[t] {This[s] might[x] look[v] pretty,}[t] but[j] {it[s] is[x] counter-productive.}[t] {Whenever anything is[x] burned[dtn],}[f] {carbon[s] is[x] released[dtn] into the atmosphere.}[t] (As a result,)[l] {you[s] could[x] argue[v] that more carbon is[x] added[v] to the air every time a candle is[x] lit[v] for Earth Hour.}[t]

(Clearly,)[l] {we[s] do[x] need[v] (to reduce)[inf] the amount of carbon in the atmosphere;}[t] {it[s] is[x] predicted[dtn] (to stay)[inf] dangerously high for years.}[t] Yet[l] (if our attention is[x] only focused[dtn] on carbon going up in the air,)[f] {we[s] miss[vxo] the chance (to take))[inf] effective action in the other direction}[t].
