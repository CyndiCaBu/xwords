{How much energy do[x] you use in the form of electricity}[t-n-nq]? {How is[x] that connected to making[ger] climate change worse or better}[t-n-nq]? {(Earth Hour)[s] is[x] an annual event that encourages people (to think)[inf] about these questions}[t-n].

{Around the world}[f-p], {people[s] turn[vxo] off all their lights, electronics and other appliances}[t-n] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[vxs] place at night and lasts[vxs] for one hour}[t=n], {as the name suggests}[extra]. {Instead of using[ger] electricity}[f-ct], {people[s] can[v] enjoy[v] the dark on their own or use[v] that time (to participate)[inf] in some kind of public gathering[ger]}[t-n]. {In many areas}[f-p], {events[s] are[x] organized[dtn] (to publicize)[inf] Earth Hour and get people talking[ger] about electricity}[t-n]. {How is[x] it[s] produced}[t-n-nq]?

{(The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn]}[t-n] {in Queens, New York}[e-p] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {(The Empire State Building)[s] is[x] usually lit[dtn] up in different colors}[t-n], but[j] {here[f-p] it[s] is[x] almost totally dark}[t-n]. {It[s] may[x] be[v] hard (to see)[inf]}[t-n-nq] {because most of the lights were[x] turned off}[e-r], {although not all of them}[extra]. {(Traffic lights)[s] were[x] kept[dtn] on}[t-p] {for obvious reasons}[e-r].
