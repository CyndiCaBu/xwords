{How much energy do[x] you use in the form of electricity}[t-n-nq]? {How is[x] that connected to making climate change worse or better}[t-n-nq]? {(Earth Hour)[s] is[x] an annual event that encourages people (to think)[inf] about these questions}[t-n].

{Around the world}[f-p], {people[s] turn[vxo] off all their lights, electronics and other appliances}[t-n] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {It[s] takes[vxs] place at night and lasts[vxs] for one hour}[t=n], {as the name suggests}[extra]. {Instead of using electricity}[f-ct], {people[s] can[v] enjoy[v] the dark on their own or use[v] that time (to participate)[inf] in some kind of public gathering}[t-n]. {In many areas}[f-p], {events[s] are[x] organized[dtn] (to publicize)[inf] Earth Hour and get people talking about electricity}[t-n]. {How is[x] it[s] produced}[t-n-nq]? Wasted? Conserved?

{(The picture above)[s] was[x] taken[dtn]}[t-n] {in Queens, New York}[e-p] {during Earth Hour}[e-t]. {(The Empire State Building)[s] is[x] usually lit[dtn] up in different colors}[t-n], but[j] {here[f-p] it[s] is[x] almost totally dark}[t-n]. {It[s] may[x] be[v] hard (to see)[inf]}[t-n-nq] {because most of the lights were[x] turned off}[e-r], {although not all of them}[extra]. {(Traffic lights)[s] were[x] kept[dtn] on}[t-p] {for obvious reasons}[e-r].

{Is[x] (Earth Hour)[s] effective}[t-n-nq]? {(Turning things off for an hour once a year)[s] will[x] not do much (to slow)[inf] down climate change}[t-n-nq]. {It[s] is[x] a symbolic action}[t-n], {not a solution to the problem of how electricity is[x] generated and used}[extra]. {It[s] may[x] also contribute[v] to the problem}[t-n-nq].

{(Many photos related to Earth Hour)[s] are[x] posted[dtn] online}[t-n] {before and after it}[e-t]. {That[s] involves[vxs] electricity}[t-n]. {(Some images)[s] show[v] messages spelled out by a group of people holding many small candles}[t-n]. {That[s] might[x] look[v] pretty}[t-n-nq], but[j] {it[s] is[x] counter-productive}[t-n]. {Whenever anything is[x] burned[dtn]}[f-t], {carbon[s] is[x] released[dtn] into the atmosphere}[t-n]. {(Burning candles for Earth Hour)[s] makes[vxs] no sense}[t-n].

{(Earth Hour)[s] could[x] become[v] more effective}[t-n] {by focusing on solutions}[e-r]. {(The amount of carbon in the atmosphere)[s] is[x] dangerously high}[t-n]. {If everyone (doesn't)[x] start changing}[f-cd], {(those carbon levels)[s] (won't)[x] go down enough (to slow)[inf] down climate change}[t-n-nq]. {Down[s] is[x] actually one direction we should[x] consider}[t-n] {for Earth Hour and every single day}[e-t]. 

{(Carbon)[s] is[x] not only in the air}[t-n-nq](;)[j] {it[s]('s)[x] also in the soil}[t-n]. {(Planting more plants and trees)[s] helps[vxs] trap more carbon underground}[t-n], {where soil microbes can[x] eat it}[extra]. {This[s] is[x] our responsibility}[t-n] - {even those of us without farms or gardens}[extra]. {In cities}[f-p], {we[s] can[x] take[v] care of street trees}[t-n] {by watering them and planting plants around them}[e-r]. {(Every patch of bare soil)[s] needs[vxs] something green growing on it}[t-n], {sucking carbon out of the atmosphere and into the soil}[extra]. {(Even houseplants)[s] can[x] help[v]}[t-n].
