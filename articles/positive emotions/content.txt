{As humans}[extra], {we[s] have[vxo] a strong survival instinct}[t-n], {a positive quality}[extra]. {We[s] also have[vxo] a negativity bias that makes it easier for us (to notice)[inf] dangers and problems than things that (won’t)[x] hurt us}[t-n]. {As a result}[l], {we[s] can[x] fall[v] into the trap of focusing on what we (don’t)[x] like and forgetting (to pay)[inf] attention to what we actually do[x] like}[t-n]. {This[s] can[x] lead[v] to a downward spiral of negative emotions}[t-n], {including boredom, frustration, doubt, anger and jealousy}[extra].

{What can[x] we[s] do[v] (to prevent)[inf] such negativity}[t-n-nq]? {(Focusing on our positive emotions)[s] is[x] an effective step}[t-n]. {(Noticing hope, interest, joy, gratitude and other positive emotions)[s] can[x] help[v] us feel better instead of worse}[t-n]. {It[s] helps[vxs] take our minds off negative emotions}[t-n], {leading to an upward spiral of positivity}[extra].

{According to research by the psychologist Barbara Fredrickson and others}[l], {(increasing our experience of positive emotions)[s] may[x] improve[v] our mental and physical health}[t-n]. {Fredrickson[s] developed[vxd] and tested[vxd] the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions}[t=p]. {When we focus on our positive feelings}[f-t], {we[s] change[vxo] how we think}[t-n]. {(Our attention)[s] becomes[vxs] broader}[t-n], so[j] {we[s] notice[vxo] more}[t-n]. {We[s] can[x] also think[v] at a higher level}[t-n], {making connections between ideas and actions}[extra]. {This[s] helps[vxs] us become more resilient}[t-n], {closer to others and even physically healthier}[extra]. 

{(Fredrickson’s research)[s] led[vxd] to a list of positive emotions that people reported feeling most often}[t-p]. {Think[vxo] about who you were[x] with, what you were[x] doing and where you were[x] the last time you felt each of the emotions listed below}[t-n-nq]. {What can[x] you[s] do[v] (to increase)[inf] your chances of experiencing these emotions}[t-n-nq]?
