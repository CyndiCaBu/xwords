<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Becoming a hero <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> mean only being a person who <span class="does_class">does</span> something special in a war. What <span class="is_class">is</span> important for a hero <span class="is_class">is</span> sacrificing part of one’s own life to help provide a better and easier life for other people. William Kamkwamba, a citizen of Malawi <span class="is_class">is</span> a great example of someone who believed in himself and struggled to defeat adversity.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">As a 14-year-old boy, William <span class="had_class">had</span> to leave school because his parents <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> have enough money to pay for it. After that, Kamkwamba decided to teach himself by going to his village’s library, which <span class="had_class">had</span> textbooks from Malawi, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe. He found the same books that students <span class="were_class">were</span> reading in his former school, so he borrowed them and asked his friends to give him updates on what they <span class="had_class">had</span> done in class each day. A few science books caught his attention, especially when he saw pictures that showed how things work. Reading in English <span class="was_class">was</span> hard, but he really liked science, and he soon began learning more and more about energy and how windmills <span class="could_class">could</span> produce it.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">By studying something that he <span class="had_class">had</span> never learned before, William developed confidence in himself and realized that he <span class="could_class">could</span> actually build a windmill. He started going to the junkyard next to his high school to find all the parts he needed, like an old wheel from a bicycle, a couple pieces of wood, plates of metal and more. He kept going, even when people made fun of him. His <span class="was_class">was</span> experimental, but it let him power an electric light bulb that he put way up at the top of the windmill. People in the village noticed the light from a distance and started changing their opinion about him; he seemed quite intelligent and skillful, not crazy after all. Thanks to his windmill, William’s family <span class="was_class">was</span> able to use simple electrical things like a light bulb so they <span class="could_class">could</span> read and study at night.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">After a Malawian newspaper wrote about William and his windmill and some bloggers from America and Nigeria shared his story, more and more people learned what he <span class="had_class">had</span> done. Soon people began helping him and they found ways for him to study in school again. He <span class="was_class">was</span> chosen to speak at a TED talk in Arusha, Tanzania that <span class="was_class">was</span> part of TEDGlobal 2007. It changed his life through the connections it helped him make and the donations he <span class="could_class">could</span> use for his family and his village. Later he created a second windmill and set up more light bulbs and some solar systems. His work let his family pump water from the ground, to drink and irrigate their fields. The whole village came to his house to get water.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">William’s hard work studying science books and building his first windmill <span class="was_class">was</span> a key to his success in life. Maybe the windmill which he created from garbage <span class="was_class">was</span>n’t so professional, but it made all the villagers’ lives easier. He found a lot of support to help him study more and more, first in special programs in Africa and eventually at Dartmouth, a prestigious college in the United States.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">William Kamkwamba became a hero in his village, showing that if we <span class="have_class">have</span> goals in life we <span class="have_class">have</span> to do everything to reach them. He opened a new way for the next generation in his village. Everyone who knows him there <span class="will_class">will</span> tell their children about the boy who decided to change his life for the better, and through hard work he actually <span class="did_class">did</span>.</p>
