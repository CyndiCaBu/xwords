<p>	In November, 2012, we went to Herald Square in Manhattan to watch the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade. We <span class="were_class">were</span> expecting to see crowds of people and a parade with huge balloons in the shape of cartoon characters and other funny designs. We <span class="did_class">did</span> see all that, of course, but while I <span class="was_class">was</span> trying to take pictures through the crowd, I heard some beautiful music playing nearby. I turned around, looking for a saxophone or some other type of horn made of metal. Imagine how surprised I <span class="was_class">was</span> when I found a man playing a horn he <span class="had_class">had</span> made out of PVC pipe. He told me that he <span class="had_class">had</span> put a traditional reed in it, to make the sound, but otherwise it <span class="was_class">was</span> made from the kind of materials you <span class="can_class">can</span> find in a hardware store or plumbing supply shop. When I asked if I <span class="could_class">could</span> use his photo on this site, he agreed and kindly gave me his business card. He <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> sound like anyone I<span class="ve_class">’ve</span> ever met from West Africa, but according to his business card, his name <span class="is_class">is</span> Abu, Abu the Flutemaker.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> Later, when I searched for information about him, I learned that he <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> always go by the name Abu. He <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> know about his musical talent for a long time, either. In one video, he explains that  at some point in his life, a gentleman <span class="had_class">had</span> left a flute in his house. He just started playing it. At first he <span class="couldnt_class">couldn’t</span> get any sound out of it, but he <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> give up. When he tried one last time, he discovered something he <span class="had_class">had</span> never known: he <span class="has_class">has</span> perfect pitch. That discovery changed his life.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> Excited about music, Abu quit his job and began dedicating himself to making and playing instruments. He often used found objects, the kinds of things that other people <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> want, so they leave them in the trash, or give them away, etc. In one video you <span class="can_class">can</span> see a marimba with wrenches for keys and a guitar made out of an old clock. He began making all kinds of instruments and playing familiar jazz songs and more.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">	Abu decided to share his talent with kids in Baltimore, where he lives. He wanted to work in recreation centers to teach kids to make drums and flutes, but he <span class="couldnt_class">couldn’t</span> get a job. Knowing that sometimes people <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> appreciate what<span class="s_class">’s</span> right in front of them, he decided to lie. Although he <span class="had_class">had</span> never been to Africa, he started wearing African clothes and saying he <span class="was_class">was</span> African. His trick worked; he got hired and went on TV. Eventually, he <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> want to lie anymore. He explains that he <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span>want younger people to think that they <span class="cant_class">can’t</span>  be creative if they<span class="re_class">’re</span> not from Somewhere Else.  (Obviously, there <span class="is_class">is</span> a long history of racism and exoticism in this story, but you <span class="can_class">can</span> figure that out for yourself.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> At age 71, when one of the videos <span class="was_class">was</span> made, Abu said that he <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> want to leave this world behind without sharing all his knowledge of how to craft instruments. Maybe that<span class="s_class">’s</span>  one of the reasons that he went all the way from Baltimore to New York for Thanksgiving, to keep spreading his talent around. I<span class="m_class">’m</span> thankful that he <span class="did_class">did</span>.</p>
