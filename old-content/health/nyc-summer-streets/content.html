<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This photo <span class="was_class">was</span> taken on the last day of NYC's 2012 Summer Streets program.  Like other cities around the world, New York <span class="has_class">has</span> celebrated public space and warmer weather by closing a major avenue for several hours and inviting the public to come out and play.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Lots of people <span class="were_class">were</span> thrilled at the chance to enjoy Park Avenue and its downtown branch, Lafayette Street, free of cars. There <span class="were_class">were</span> people riding bikes, walking, zooming past on skateboards, etc. The city <span class="had_class">had</span>  organized various rest stops along the way, with dance and fitness workshops, water stations, art projects, bike repair and much more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The Foley Square rest stop <span class="was_class">was</span> very close to the Brooklyn Bridge, and it <span class="had_class">had</span>  several fun activities. There <span class="was_class">was</span> an amazing jump rope demonstration by a group of young people who <span class="had_class">had</span> clearly practiced their skills for years. An appreciative crowd <span class="was_class">was</span>  watching them, while others <span class="were_class">were</span>  waiting to try a zip line in front of a court house. Another popular option <span class="was_class">was</span>  fitness testing, provided by a group called Asphalt Green. They <span class="had_class">had</span>  set up equipment like what you see in the photo above and invited people to  find out if they <span class="were_class">were</span>  as fit as a 5th grader.  Recent studies <span class="have_class">have</span>  indicated that there <span class="are_class">are</span>  valid anatomical reasons why some people <span class="can_class">can</span> do what the man in the photo <span class="is_class">is</span> trying to do and others <span class="cant_class">can’t</span>, but we <span class="wont_class">won’t</span>  get into that here.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">How about you? If you <span class="were_class">were</span>  offered a choice between jumping rope in a rhythmic, acrobatic way, riding a zip line or doing pull-ups, which <span class="would_class">would</span> you rather try?</p>
