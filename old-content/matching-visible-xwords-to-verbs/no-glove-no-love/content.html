<p><strong>No glove, no love.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">I <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> remember what caught my eye first. It <span class="might_class">might</span> have been the basket of free condoms with the NYC logo, or it <span class="could_class">could</span> have been the message: No glove, no love.</p>
<p>I <span class="must_class">must</span> admit that this isn&#8217;t the type of glove I think of when it&#8217;s cold outside. Most gloves <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> come in wrappers and they <span class="should_class">should</span> have 5 fingers, <span class="shouldnt_class">shouldn&#8217;t</span> they? Hmm.</p>
<p>Maybe the term <span class="doesnt_class">doesn&#8217;t</span> matter. The real point is protection. People <span class="may_class">may</span> joke about it or say they <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> like it, but if this <span class="can_class">can</span> help prevent transmission of HIV, <span class="dont_class">don&#8217;t</span> you think it&#8217;s worth it?</p>
<p>The picture was taken at a bookstore in lower Manhattan. It&#8217;s called Housing Works and the people who work there are volunteers, sharing a mission: ending HIV/AIDS and homelessness. Activists and others have worked on this goal since at least 1990. A lot of progress has been made, but more <span class="can_class">can</span> be done.</p>
<p>What are you doing to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and ways people <span class="can_class">can</span> stay safe?</p>
