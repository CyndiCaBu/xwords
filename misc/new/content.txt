You can[x] find people all around the world who enjoy eating fish and rice, or rice and beans, or all three. This picture was[x] taken by the filmmaker Naheem Adio, but he (didn’t)[x] tell me who dropped the food or how or why. It could[x] be from the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, so it might[x] be from a street vendor. On the other hand, it could[x] also be from a restaurant.

Wherever it was[x] made, it looks delicious, even though it has[x] already fallen on the sidewalk. If you use your imagination, you can[x] almost feel the lettuce and peppers crunching between your teeth. Depending where you’re[x] from, maybe you can[x] feel your fingers pulling pieces of the fish away from the skin and the bones. Perhaps you’d[x] prefer a fork, which would[x] be cleaner but a little more difficult than your fingers. The tomato looks like it might[x] be firm and not as juicy as a farm fresh tomato, but we can[x] pretend that it’s[x] full of flavor. The rice and beans look tasty, too.

The whole dish looks something that someone was[x] really looking forward to eating. Too bad it ended up where it did[x]!
