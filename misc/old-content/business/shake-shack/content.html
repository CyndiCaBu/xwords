<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">	When you think of classic American road food  like hamburgers, french fries, and milkshakes, <span class="do_class">do</span> you see any connection to democracy? How about urban renewal? If you  <span class="have_class">have</span> ever heard the history of the Shake Shack, maybe you <span class="do_class">do</span>. It<span class="s_class">’s</span>  a restaurant with  and more.  Shake Shack <span class="has_class">has</span> grown in popularity so much that it <span class="has_class">has</span> expanded both in New York City, where it started, in other cities in the U.S., and even abroad. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The first Shake Shack, pictured here, <span class="was_class">was</span> built in Madison Square Park, near the famous Flatiron building. Like other public parks in the city, Madison Square Park <span class="has_class">has</span> changed a lot over the years. It <span class="has_class">has</span> gone through a period of ups and downs, but businesses like Shake Shack  <span class="have_class">have</span>  had a positive influence. They represent the public-private partnerships that <span class="have_class">have</span> increased in New York City’s parks over the last decade or so. Although you <span class="could_class">could</span>  certainly find reasons to criticize these partnerships, you <span class="could_class">could</span>  also thank them for making the parks cleaner and safer. Shake Shack <span class="is_class">is</span>  a good example of a private business that <span class="might_class">might</span> seem like it<span class="s_class">’s</span> for rich people but it <span class="has_class">has</span> some lower-priced products, too. As a matter of fact, it actually started with a connection to democracy. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The origins of Shake Shack <span class="are_class">are</span> linked to a partnership between its founder, Danny Meyer, and a Thai artist, Navin Rawanchaikul. The artist’s show “I Love Taxi” <span class="was_class">was</span> a political statement about democracy as well as a fun work of art. It involved taxi cabs painted with faces and other designs and a fully functioning hot dog cart.  You <span class="might_class">might</span> wonder how this <span class="is_class">is</span>  connected to democracy. As Danny Meyer  explained in an interview, “The 2 most democratic things in the world <span class="are_class">are</span> hot dog carts and taxi cabs, because everyone in the world <span class="has_class">has</span> either been able to afford to take a taxi ride or had to be the guy driving the taxi. And everyone in the world <span class="has_class">has</span> either been able to buy a hot dog or had to be the guy selling it.” </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Whether you agree with that or not, if you appreciate a successful business you <span class="might_class">might</span>  want to learn a little more about Shake Shack. There <span class="are_class">are</span> people who look down on it, wondering why anyone <span class="would_class">would</span>  pay so much money for a simple hamburger. Others say that you <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> always get such a delicious burger in such a lovely setting, and you get what you pay for in terms of the quality of the ingredients. If you <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> want hormones or antibiotics in your meat, Shake Shack <span class="is_class">is</span>  a good place to go. The menu <span class="can_class">can</span>  change depending on the location and the season, but you<span class="re_class">’re</span> almost guaranteed to find burgers and milkshakes no matter where or when you go. </p>
