<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> have to love math to appreciate Pi Day. The enthusiasm of math lovers <span class="can_class">can</span> brighten anyone&#8217;s day on March 14th every year. There <span class="are_class">are</span> plenty of ways to celebrate the number 3.14159265&#8230;etc., especially by measuring circles and doing some division.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">In some places, you <span class="can_class">can</span> solve math problems in exchange for a piece of pizza. You <span class="might_class">might</span> never actually call it pizza pie, but it <span class="is_class">is</span> a salty type of pie. If you <span class="would_class">would</span> rather have something sweet, you <span class="can_class">can</span> celebrate 3.14 with a fruit pie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">At the W. Rogowski farm stand on the Pi Day of the century, 3.1415, there <span class="were_class">were</span> lots of fresh ingredients people <span class="could_class">could</span> buy to make a veggie pie, better known as a quiche. It <span class="was_class">was</span> raining off and on most of the day, but anyone who <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> mind the rain <span class="could_class">could</span> hang out and talk about math with one of these guys, a real math expert. He <span class="had_class">had</span> a great pi shirt showing not only the number 3.1415 but the fascinating way that number <span class="is_class">is</span> part of any circle, no matter how big or how small.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">According to the MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics, pi <span class="is_class">is</span> &#8220;the relationship between the distance around a circle and the distance through it.&#8221; Test it for yourself. If you start measuring and doing the math, you <span class="will_class">will</span> find the result to be 3.14159265&#8230;etc. every time. Happy Pi Day!</p>
