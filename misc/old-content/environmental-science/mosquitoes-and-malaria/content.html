<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> Growing up in the northeastern part of the U.S., I never knew much about malaria. To me, mosquitoes <span class="were_class">were</span> something to avoid, but getting bitten <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span>  mean getting sick. It just meant that I <span class="would_class">would</span> have an itchy bump on my skin for a few days until it got better.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> As an adult, I learned much more about malaria and the way human behavior <span class="can_class">can</span>  make it easier or harder to prevent and treat diseases. A friend told me about how she <span class="had_class">had</span> worked as a doctor on a tuberculosis (TB) treatment program in her native country, Somalia. She explained that many patients who <span class="had_class">had</span> tested positive for TB <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> take their medicine for all the time that they needed to. Because many people <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span>  get a good education when they <span class="were_class"> were</span> younger, they <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> understand the way the disease and the medicine worked. They thought that if they felt better, they <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> need to continue taking the medicine. Many also thought that their illness <span class="was_class">was</span>  caused by something like witchcraft, or a curse from someone who wanted to harm them. Obviously, the truth <span class="is_class">is</span> much different. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> A few years after I <span class="had_class">had</span>  heard about TB and other tropical diseases from my friend, I went to West Africa to visit some friends who <span class="were_class">were</span> working in Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia. I <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> want to get sick from malaria, so I took medicine to prevent it. Since I <span class="had_class">had</span>  all the privileges of an outsider, I <span class="was_class">was</span>  given a mosquito net to sleep under at night, and I used mosquito repellent. I also wore long sleeves and long pants whenever I <span class="could_class">could</span>  and tried to avoid the times of day when mosquitoes <span class="are_class">are</span> most active. I <span class="had_class">had</span>  the knowledge and the resources  to try to prevent malaria. I also knew that if I <span class="did_class">did</span> get sick, I <span class="could_class">could</span>  find treatment. That <span class="should_class">should</span> not be a privilege in the modern world. When I heard that some of the local people <span class="had_class">had</span> gotten malaria, I asked about medicine. Most <span class="were_class">were</span> able to find it, but they <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> always take it as long as they <span class="were_class">were</span>  supposed to. I <span class="was_class">was</span> disappointed and disgusted, thinking that the local schools and culture <span class="had_class">had</span>  failed  to teach people the link between taking medicine correctly and preventing malaria.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> When I went back to the U.S., I <span class="was_class">was</span>  surprised to learn that malaria <span class="had_class">had</span>  been a problem in northern areas in the past. The first time I heard about it in New York <span class="was_class">was</span> at the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. There <span class="s_class">’s</span>  a model of a huge mosquito in one section, with information about how malaria <span class="had_class">had</span> once affected the city. By making an effort  to prevent it, New York <span class="had_class">had</span> succeeded in eradicating the disease. The problem <span class="is_class">is</span>  complicated and enormous, but why <span class="cant_class">can’t</span>  other areas do likewise? </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> The reality <span class="is_class">is</span>  that malaria <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span>  cost much to prevent or treat, but it <span class="can_class">can</span>  take a country years and years before they manage to get rid of it. Even today, when billions of dollars <span class="are_class">are</span> spent to fight malaria, it <span class="is_class">is</span>  blamed for far too many deaths. It <span class="is_class">is</span>  also considered an economic factor, in many ways. People who <span class="are_class">are</span>  too sick <span class="cant_class">can’t</span>  work, so they lose money. People who <span class="are_class">are</span> too poor and <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> get access to free medicine <span class="dont_class">don’t</span>  have an effective way to find treatment. Drug resistance <span class="has_class">has</span>  become a major problem, too. What kind of solutions <span class="can_class">can</span> you think of?</p>
