<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Earth Hour <span class="is_class">is</span> celebrated around the world every year. It <span class="is_class">is</span> meant to draw attention to how much energy we use in the form of electricity and to call attention to climate change. People <span class="are_class">are</span> asked to turn off all their lights, electronics and other appliances for one hour and enjoy the dark or use that time to participate in some kind of public gathering. In many areas, events <span class="are_class">are</span> organized to publicize Earth Hour and get people talking about electricity and how it <span class="is_class">is</span> not only produced but also both wasted and conserved.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The picture above <span class="was_class">was</span> taken in Queens, New York during the 2013 Earth Hour. The Empire State Building <span class="is_class">is</span> usually lit up in different colors, but here it <span class="is_class">is</span> almost totally dark. It <span class="may_class">may</span> be hard to see because most of the lights <span class="were_class">were</span> turned off, although not all of them. Traffic lights <span class="were_class">were</span> kept on for obvious reasons.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The whole idea of Earth Hour <span class="is_class">is</span> criticized by people who say turning things off for an hour once a year <span class="will_class">will</span> not do much to slow down climate change. It <span class="is_class">is</span> a symbolic action, not a solution to the problem of how electricity <span class="is_class">is</span> generated and used. Many photos <span class="are_class">are</span> posted online before and after Earth Hour, which means that electricity <span class="is_class">is</span> involved after all. Some show messages that <span class="are_class">are</span> spelled out by a group of people holding many small candles. Unfortunately, whenever anything <span class="is_class">is</span> burned, carbon <span class="is_class">is</span> released into the atmosphere. As a result, you <span class="could_class">could</span> argue that more carbon <span class="is_class">is</span> added to the air every time a candle <span class="is_class">is</span> lit for Earth Hour.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Clearly, we <span class="do_class">do</span> need to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere; it <span class="is_class">is</span> predicted to stay dangerously high for years. Yet if our attention <span class="is_class">is</span> only focused on carbon going up in the air, we miss the chance to take effective action in the other direction. Of course we <span class="should_class">should</span> work on conserving energy and using more renewable sources of it, but we <span class="should_class">should</span> also consider how farming and gardening <span class="are_class">are</span> connected to carbon. When soils <span class="are_class">are</span> improved, more carbon <span class="is_class">is</span> trapped safely underground. The more the most appropriate plants <span class="are_class">are</span> grown all over the world, the more carbon <span class="is_class">is</span> kept out of the atmosphere and used in a healthy process. If you <span class="are_class">are</span> invited to participate in Earth Hour this year, please support plant life at the same time. When you plant a seed or get a houseplant, you help get carbon out of the air and into the roots and the soil.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The passage above was written with the DTN form in mind, so it might not sound completely natural. The point is to let go of the idea that the "ed" ending always refers to the past. If there's a BE x-word first, then the x-word shows the time. In traditional grammar, BE + DTN is called the passive form. The focus is on whatever happened, not who did it.</p>
