<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">On the night of Manhattanhenge, we <span class="were_class">were</span> waiting for a bus in Queens with a camera ready to take pictures of the setting sun. The whole point of Manhattanhenge <span class="is_class">is</span> to watch the sun lining up perfectly with the east-west streets in Manhattan as it sets. In other words, depending on the weather, the sun <span class="can_class">can</span> look like a big red or orange ball falling exactly between tall buildings. This phenomenon <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> happen often; Manhattanhenge <span class="is_class">is</span> only 4 times a year.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">While we <span class="were_class">were</span> on the way to take pictures of the sunset, there <span class="were_class">were</span> a couple of people waiting near us and a few more across the street from the bus stop. One <span class="was_class">was</span> a man playing the guitar and the others <span class="were_class">were</span> taking photos of him and maybe making a video, too. They <span class="were_class">were</span> all in front of 5 Pointz, the famous graffiti-covered art center in Long Island City. We <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> know who the man playing the guitar <span class="was_class">was</span>, but we liked the way he looked in the late afternoon sun and we enjoyed his music. Unfortunately, we <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> get a chance to ask him for his name, because the bus came after we <span class="had_class">had</span> only taken a couple of pictures. We <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> want to miss it, since the sun <span class="was_class">was</span> going to set in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The reason you <span class="can_class">can</span> see a picture of the guitar player here instead of the sunset <span class="is_class">is</span> that we <span class="didnt_class">didn’t</span> get good pictures of Manhattanhenge after all. Maybe we<span class="ll_class">’ll</span> <span class="have_class">have</span> better luck next time.</p>
