<p>Thanks to a grant from Partnerships for Parks and the Greening Western Queens Program, as well as the help of many hardworking volunteers, Long Island City <span class="is_class">is</span> getting greener. There <span class="are_class">are</span> many new plants growing in tree pits near LaGuardia Community College, and more <span class="will_class">will</span> come in spring 2015. They<span class="re_class">’re</span> all perennials, which means that they<span class="ll_class">’ll</span> come back every year.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Why <span class="did_class">did</span> we add plants to places meant for trees? We<span class="re_class">’re</span> trying to follow one easy rule: no naked soil! In other words, we know how important it <span class="is_class">is</span> to keep the ground covered at all times. That <span class="can_class">can</span> mean covering it with plants that we enjoy looking at, or plants that we use mostly to nourish the soil, or at the very least, compost and mulch. With plants, an important purpose <span class="is_class">is</span> to help capture carbon in the soil and brighten an industrial area. They <span class="may_class">may</span> also encourage people to take care of street trees by watering them.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The red and yellow flowers here <span class="were_class">were</span> still blooming in mid-November, but the plants <span class="were_class">were</span> definitely getting ready for winter. Even as the flowers turn to seeds, these plants <span class="are_class">are</span> a powerful symbol of life and hope. Meanwhile, their roots and all the beneficial organisms below ground <span class="are_class">are</span> helping the soil.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">In a city as big and complex as New York, it makes sense for people to help take care of the trees. While many <span class="arent_class">aren’t</span> interested in that at all, others <span class="are_class">are</span> really happy when they find out they <span class="can_class">can</span> help by watering trees, removing weeds, planting perennials, and adding mulch and compost. You <span class="can_class">can</span> see the difference between young trees that people take care of and those that have to struggle to survive on their own. If you like breathing oxygen, you <span class="might_class">might</span> want to consider helping your nearest trees!</p>
