Imagine that you <span class="are_class">are</span> living in the year 2222, and the plants in the picture <span class="are_class">are</span> still growing. The yellow flower <span class="is_class">is</span> from the prickly pear cactus, also known as nopal. Somehow it grew through four seasons of extreme temperatures and kept growing year after year. It thrived in the heat of summer and survived the freezing cold and heavy snow of winter. It wrapped itself around a tree in front of an Italian restaurant, just to the south. The flower  <span class="is_class">is</span> facing west, looking towards the Empire State building towering in the distance.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">What <span class="does_class">does</span> a symbol of Mexico mean when you find it outside an Italian restaurant in New York? You <span class="might_class">might</span> guess that some people from Mexico worked in the restaurant or lived in the neighborhood. (You<span class="d_class">’d </span> be right.) You <span class="could_class">could</span> look for clues about a link between Mexico and New York. You<span class="d_class">’d </span> probably find many, since people went back and forth between these places for generations, but you <span class="might_class">might</span> not guess that the owners of the restaurant <span class="were_class">were</span> from Ecuador. Still, that<span class="s_class">’s </span> not surprising. It<span class="s_class">’s </span> just part of the international nature of New York.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Actually, seeing these plants in 2222 <span class="isnt_class">isn’t</span> realistic. They <span class="wouldnt_class">wouldn’t</span> live that long, but maybe they <span class="could_class">could</span> reproduce. After all, the prickly pear cactus, also known as nopal, <span class="has_class">has</span> been around for thousands of years.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">According to an ancient legend, the Aztecs believed that they <span class="should_class">should</span> build a temple and a city in a special place. In the early 1300s, they <span class="were_class">were</span> looking for an eagle eating a snake, sitting on top of a nopal cactus. The cactus <span class="would_class">would</span> be growing on a rock coming out of the water. They found that on an island in Lake Texcoco. That<span class="s_class">’s</span> where they built the capital of their powerful empire. They called it Tenochtitlán.<p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">You <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> see it under the sidewalk, but there <span class="is_class">is</span> water below New York, too. In some places, it<span class="s_class">’s</span> only 4 feet below the surface. There <span class="might_class">might</span> not be eagles, but there <span class="are_class">are</span> definitely hawks in Queens. <span class="do_class">Do</span> you think a bird <span class="might_class">might</span> land on the nopal in this picture? <span class="could_class">Could</span> it be a symbol of a place to build a new empire? We<span class="d_class">’d </span>have to ask the person who planted it. To some, it just represents hope. It reminds us to adapt and persevere, no matter what.</p>
