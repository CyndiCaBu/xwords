Community supported agriculture (CSA) <span class="is_class">is</span> a system that <span class="can_class">can</span> benefit both farmers and the people who buy their crops. The customer pays for a season’s worth of produce in advance, which helps the farmer financially by guaranteeing a certain amount of income. It <span class="can_class">can</span> help with planning, so that way the farmer <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> have worry about whether or not a certain crop <span class="will_class">will</span> sell well at the market. Farmers <span class="can_class">can</span> use websites, word of mouth and other ways to try to get CSA customers during the off-season, when they <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> have to spend incredibly long days taking care of the farm.

Many farms give customers an idea of what they <span class="can_class">can</span> expect during the season, but you never know what you<span class="re_class">’re</span> going to get until you actually get it. This element of surprise <span class="is_class">is</span> one of the fun parts of being involved in a CSA. It <span class="can_class">can</span> be a chance to try vegetables that you <span class="might_class">might</span> not choose on your own, or that you <span class="may_class">may</span> not even recognize. You <span class="might_class">might</span> discover something that you really like but <span class="had_class">had</span> never tried. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">
The way a CSA usually works <span class="is_class">is</span> that the customer goes to the farm or a pickup location once a week and takes home a box or bag of whatever the farmer <span class="has_class">has</span> harvested. In some cases, this <span class="can_class">can</span> include eggs or flowers and there <span class="may_class">may</span> be some flexibility. For instance, if you <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> want cucumbers, you <span class="might_class">might</span> be able to trade them for carrots. The best part <span class="is_class">is</span> that the food <span class="is_class">is</span> fresh and the business model <span class="has_class">has</span> helped thousands of farmers over the years.
