<p> Tom Fruin <span class="is_class">is</span> an artist who <span class="was_class">was</span>  born in Los Angeles, California. He <span class="has_class">has</span> exhibited his work around the world, in places as far apart as Buenos Aires, Argentina  and Copenhagen, Denmark. Like other artists who <span class="would_class">would</span> like to show their work and probably sell it, he <span class="is_class">is</span> represented by a gallery. Although Fruin <span class="has_class">has</span> lived in and worked in Brooklyn, New York for many years, the gallery that represents his work <span class="is_class">is</span>  in Geneva, Switzerland. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> One of the interesting aspects of Fruin’s art <span class="is_class">is</span> the way he makes things from found objects. That means he <span class="can_class">can</span>  create something beautiful and/or interesting from what <span class="might_class">might</span>  seem like trash. He <span class="has_class">has</span> made several pieces from small plastic bags that <span class="were_class">were</span> thrown away by people using marijuana and other drugs. He collected the bags from parks and sidewalks and then sewed them together to make what he called “urban quilts.” Obviously those <span class="are_class">are</span> not the types of quilts that <span class="can_class">can</span> keep you warm on a cold night, but you <span class="could_class">could</span>  use his work to think about drug problems in a different way. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> The water tower pictured here <span class="was_class">was</span> made from around 1,000 pieces of colorful plexiglass, which <span class="are_class">are</span> held together by steel. It <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span>  have any water inside, of course, but it <span class="does_class">does</span> have a light installation by another artist, Ryan Holsopple. You <span class="can_class">can</span>  see the tower from the East River and other parts of Brooklyn, but if you <span class="would_class">would</span>  rather get a closer view, you <span class="can_class">can</span>  find a good spot to look at it from under the Manhattan Bridge. When you first get to DUMBO, the area found “Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass,” it <span class="might_class">might</span> be hard to see the water tower, but if you keep looking, you<span class="ll_class">’ll</span>  find it. </p>
