<p>Like some other mammals, when puppies <span class="are_class">are</span> first born they <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> see clearly. Their eyes <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> open for about 2 weeks, and they <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> really hear or smell either. Nevertheless, they <span class="can_class">can</span> always find their mother to nurse. The mother dog <span class="is_class">is </span>usually quite protective of her puppies and <span class="wont_class">won’t</span> willingly let anyone near them. They <span class="will_class">will</span> all feel better if they <span class="have_class">have</span> a quiet, protected area where they <span class="can_class">can</span> be together, without much interference. They just need food and fresh water. Other than that, they <span class="will_class">will</span> do better on their own. If a puppy crawls away or gets lost among its siblings, the mother dog’s favorite human <span class="could_class">could</span> try to help, but in general people <span class="should_class">should</span> not pick up newborn puppies. The mother dog <span class="would_class">would</span> probably growl and she <span class="might_class">might</span> even bite, especially if she sees someone who she <span class="doesnt_class">doesn’t</span> trust near her puppies. All that <span class="would_class">would</span> cause unnecessary stress for the dogs as well as the humans. A few weeks after the birth, the puppies <span class="will_class">will</span> be ready to start really exploring the world and the mother dog <span class="will_class">will</span> get back to normal.</p>
