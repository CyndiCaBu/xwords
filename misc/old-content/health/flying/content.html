<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><span class="are_class">Are</span> you afraid of heights? There <span class="are_class">are</span> some people who <span class="cant_class">can’t</span> look over the edge of a cliff or a tall building without feeling a little queasy, but others <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> share that kind of reaction at all. They <span class="would_class">would</span> love the chance to go paragliding or hang-gliding, to feel the freedom of moving through the air and looking all around at the sky and the mountains, like a bird. Of course, you probably need to be in good shape to do that because you <span class="might_class">might</span> have to run a little as you land. It depends on the wind, but the idea <span class="is_class">is</span> to keep moving so that you <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> just crash into the ground.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">If you<span class="d_class">’d</span> rather use resources other than your own energy, you <span class="could_class">could</span> try a hot air balloon. The landing <span class="may_class">may</span> still be bumpy, but the flight <span class="can_class">can</span> last longer. You ride in a basket, and it<span class="s_class">’s </span> generally a smooth, quiet flight. Some baskets even have places where you <span class="can_class">can</span> sit down if you want to.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">If you <span class="dont_class">don’t</span> mind burning some type of fuel to get yourself up in the air, you <span class="could_class">could</span> try parasailing. You start in a motor boat and wear a lifejacket, but you probably <span class="wont_class">won’t</span> get wet. You wear a harness that gets attached to a parachute, and your legs rest on something that looks like a swing. As the boat speeds through the water, you begin to float slowly up in the air. When you come down, someone on the boat helps you land gently, in a standing position.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"><span class="do_class">Do</span> any of these types of flight sound like fun, or <span class="would_class">would</span> you rather leave flying to birds and insects?</p>
