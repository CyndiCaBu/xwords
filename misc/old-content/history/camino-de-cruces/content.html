<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This <span class="is_class">is</span> a trail between the Pacific and the Caribbean. It<span class="s_class">’s</span> called the Camino de Cruces, or Trail of Crosses. A historic trail, it<span class="s_class">’s</span> made of stones. It<span class="s_class">’s</span> a trail where the Spaniards took the gold that they <span class="were_class">were</span> carrying out of Peru, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. To be more specific, the Indians <span class="were_class">were</span> the ones who carried the gold. Once it reached Porto Belo, in the Atlantic, it <span class="was_class">was</span> shipped to Spain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;">This trail <span class="hasnt_class">hasn’t</span> been lost in Panama. It<span class="s_class">’s</span> been erased by all the new buildings, but part of it still exists. Finally, after looking for it for a long time, I decided to walk down it today, for 20 marvelous kilometers. Now I<span class="m_class">’m</span> completely exhausted but so happy to <span class="have_class">have</span> walked on it. One of the wonderful things <span class="is_class">is</span> that when you walk, you <span class="have_class">have</span> time to think of everyone, each and every person. Best wishes to all of you!</p>
