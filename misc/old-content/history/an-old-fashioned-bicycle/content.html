<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> Hmmm&#8230; <span class="have_class">have</span>  you ever ridden an old-fashioned bicycle? It looks pretty in the image that <span class="was_class">was</span> etched in this glass window, but it <span class="doesnt_class">doesnâ€™t</span> look comfortable. Looking at it brings several questions to mind. Why <span class="is_class">is</span> the front wheel so much bigger than rear? Back when these bikes <span class="were_class">were</span> popular, <span class="did_class">did</span> women ride them? If so, how <span class="did_class">did</span> they do it? And <span class="did_class">did</span> they wear pants or long dresses? In socio-economic terms, <span class="were_class">were</span> these bikes used by people of all social classes, from the richest of the rich to the poorest of the poor? In practical terms, <span class="do_class">do</span> you think they <span class="were_class">were</span>  used for delivery, the way modern bikes <span class="are_class">are</span> used in New York today? If so, that <span class="could_class">could</span> lead to more questions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30pt;"> This photo <span class="was_class">was</span> taken outside a restaurant in the East Village of Manhattan, probably on 12th Street. That restaurant probably <span class="has_class">has</span> a delivery service, <span class="doesnt_class">doesn&#8217;t</span> it? If it <span class="does_class">does</span> , what kind of bike <span class="do_class">do</span>  the delivery people ride? If you <span class="were_class">were</span>  one of them, <span class="would_class">would</span> you like it to be a bike like this? You <span class="would_class">would</span> need to have good balance and you <span class="could_class">could</span> not be afraid of heights. With a little practice, you <span class="might_class">might</span> have fun delivering food in the 21st century like someone who <span class="was_class">was</span> born more than a hundred years before you. </p>
