# Hidden X-Words
 - automating
 - get verb list - any past tense verb has a hidden "did"

 -
 (have,has,had) + (word that ends in `ed`) != hidden did
 ie I have talked, she has worked,

Look for simple past and identify hidden did
 - simple past = vdx (hidden did)
 - list of words

Simple present (identify verb with hidden does)
 - hidden xword = vxs
 - list of words

# Verbs

# Hidden x words
## vxd - hidden did
 - use vxd word list
 - rule: cant have "has" "had" "have" to the left (immediate or more)


## vxs - hidden does
 - similar concept to vxd
Pick out do/does/did/have/has/had without a verb to the right
then it's a verb with a hidden x-word
 how to know if the verb is acting like an xword or a verb? (do/has can be tricky)

# vxo - hidden do
 - word list with no xword to the left
 - same as base form

# Lists of words we need:
 - xwords
 - spreasheet of: base form, vxs, vxd, dtn, ing
 - shifters
 - linkers

# XV
 - find x word and find the verb
 - mark x word then mark verb (verb will be to the right of the xword and is usually the left most)

# Subjects
 - mark the x word, the subject is immediately to the left (can be several words) up to
   the start of the sentence or comma or "frequent word" (from a list)
